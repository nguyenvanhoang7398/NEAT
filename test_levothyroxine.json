I went to my primary doctor who said it was 6 weeks since the last test so it was worth another to see what is happening. We did not do the antibodies as we all know that is NOT going to alter? (or that is what I am told) She decided just to do TSH, Free T4 and Free T3. Well since my last tests and going on the \"maintenance\" dose of 50 mg of thyroxine results are; Free T4 - 18.4 ( 11.0 - 21.00 ) has increased Free T3 - ( 3.1 - 6.0 ) has increased TSH .61 - ( 0.5 - 5.5 ) Decreased further Have no idea what it all means just know I feel really hyper at the moment and not sure why or what needs to be done?

You are the only reason I came on here. I watched this board for almost 5 years and never posted anything. Truth be told, I never had anything to say until my situation was resolved a week or so ago. I didn't know if waiting was the proper thing, like you. It turned out for me to be the right thing. But know that eventually, because of the growth of the nodule, I did have to take half my thyroid. But know that it also was benign. You see, most of them are benign that have hurthle cells. And with hashi's it's more likely to be benign because it's common to get nodules when you have hashi's thyroiditis. It's you and others like you that will keep me returning to this board to share my experiences. Thanks for being so kind to acknowledge me. Please keep me posted on your situation. Has your nodule being growing at all???? "}, "10": {"a": "56114", "t": "Well, my nodule was complex. Both solid and cystic qualities. As you probably know, solid nodules tend to be more likely cancerous than cystic nodules. Complex (both solid/cystic) nodules are more likely to be cancer than cystic but less likely than solid. Blood flow is seen in solid nodules, not in cystic ones I think. Remember that your doctor's would not be recommending watching this (if they are good doctor's) if they thought this was cancer. Nodules like ours usually are benign. 80/20 chance statistically. I'd take those odds in Vegas any day. In fact, I did take those odds and it paid off. Yours is also not growing. That is a fantastic sign. Cancer USUALLY grows. If your nodule is not changing, that's why they are continuing to watch it. Until mine started growing, they would have kept watching it forever I guess. Even if yours starts to grow (if it's slow and steady), remember that benign nodules grow! I'm proof of that. Don't worry about blood flow. Your doctor's know what to look for as far as the appearance of your nodule. I think they are looking for change more than anything. Also, one other thing. For most of the 4+ years my nodule was being watched, I was getting my U/S's every 4 months. So it seems to me that your doctor's are pretty confident your nodule isn't cancer. But I would ask them exactly that. \"Doctor, do you think this is benign?\" They will probably say that with hurthle cells one can never be sure without surgery, but they feel it's benign. I know my doctor was conservative and originally wanted to remove it, but because I was so terrified of the surgery, he agreed to wait. But not when he thought he was no longer comfortable with the nodule growth. Then he insisted I remove at least half. I am so lucky because I have the greatest Endocrinologist. I hope you have/find a doctor like him. I do not know anything about meds since I've never been on them. But read the board. There are a lot of very knowledgeable people on here that have tons of experience with medication and function issues and how they might possibly relate to your thyroid nodule issue.

Because of all I've read here, I asked him how he treats patients that are hypo. I didn't want to tell him what I've read on here about other peoples stories because, while I know that he is fantastic when it comes to dealing with nodules, I don't know who he treats thyroid functioning problems. When I asked him if he treats based on TSH levels, he said that everyone's normal is different. For one person it might be 2.0, for another it might be closer to 1. When I asked him if he treats based on blood test results or symptoms, he said both. He said that the important thing is to treat each patient individually and find out what levels are normal for them and treat them accordingly. I did not lead him to these answers, but because of many of you, I wanted to know how much he knew about thyroid issues and if he would be someone that would treat them correctly IF/WHEN it happens to me, and I'm very happy to say, he had all the right answers. He did say it was a little too soon (2 weeks) after my surgery to tell if I will have hypo or not (unlike what would have happened if I had a TT) and also I have hashimoto's. He said 50% of the time someone has a partial, they do not require medicine, that the half that's there does do the work it needs to do.

In your daughters situation, only because of her sister, I would have surgery much sooner than I did. I elected to only have half removed because the nodule in question was what I wanted to analyze.

But my endo said yesterday the chance of it being cancer due to the other nodule being benign is 99%. Good odds. Anyway, I was wondering what the size of your daughters nodule is. Do you know? Anyway, when you only remove half your thyroid, you are only putting half your parathyroid glands and half your vocal cords at risk. Get a good surgeon, one that comes highly recommended by other doctors and patients and IF POSSIBLE, I would get only the half with the nodule removed so that there's no chance that your younger daughter will experience what her older sister did. There is very little chance of calcium issues when you only remove half your thyroid. Also, she wouldn't lose her voice. Of course, this is just one more opinion and of course, she has to do what is best for her. But the more information you arm yourself with, the better.

And let's not forget that old standby, Agent Orange. It's weird you brought this up. I have not done anything about it yet, and only heard of this less than a year ago and never related my thyroid issues to it, but I guess it's possible. Your daughters nodule is the size mine started off being. 2 years later, like hers, it only grew about 3 mm's. After that though, it started growing slowly, but consistently until it eventually (after another 2 years) reached 3.4 cm's. That's when I had it out and it turned out to be benign. As far as having a reaction to medication...... if you are worried about the anesthesia, she needs to tell the anesthesiologist before the surgery about any and all reactions, allergies or sensitivities to medicine or anything else she has. They know how to deal with it. I had a sensitivity to codeine and also I had gotten very sick from anesthesia in the past (severe vomiting) and so the anesthesiologist dealt with it perfectly and I didn't even get nauseous once after surgery.

As far as being suspicious for follicular neoplasm, so was mine after the 2nd FNA. I did have it taken out at that point, but you must remember, mine grew quite a bit and had cells that can be found in both benign and malignant nodules. Remember 95% of nodules are benign. My chances, given everything were 80/20 in favor of benignity and it was benign. Your chances are very good. As far as whether it's a good sign or not that the nodule doesn't bother you. I don't think it's a good sign or a bad sign. Your nodule is not that large and depending on exactly where it is and how it's formed, you very well might not feel any symptoms. Mine was 3.4 cm when it was removed and while I could see it when I swallowed, it didn't cause any symptoms either. I didn't really feel it. So, no.....that isn't a sign of anything to me. I'm not sure why your doc says this must be removed, other than your doc is very cautious and without a benign FNA he wants to know for sure that it's benign and the only way to know that conclusively is by removing it.

So I started a low dose of Levothyroxine and a compounded hormone cream on Friday and I?ve been feeling worse. I read that with the hormone cream you can have something called ?Estrogen Dominance Wake-Up Crisis? and feel worse before you feel better. Since Friday I?ve only had 2 good days and that was Friday & Saturday. Sunday ? Tuesday (today) I?ve had the worst muscle aches and pain along with migraines. And I started having some joint pain in my fingers about a month ago and it feels worse also. I made an appt w/my Dr for this Thursday. I am ready to ask for something to just help me deal with the pain until the meds he prescribed kicked in. I work full-time and have a 2 year old?as much as I?d like, I can?t stay in bed!! I?m wondering if anyone else has experienced this ? the muscle aches and migraines. The tension in my upper back/shoulder is so bad it's triggering a tension migraine. How do you handle it?

A week or so worth of testing, blood, heart, lungs who knows, everything showed negative. They then gave me the Spinal Tap. Well the Spinal tap showed what they call bands, 4 of them, which are seen in patients with MS. So they ran more tests to exclude anything else, then did open head surgery and performed a brain biopsy. They ran some tests here on a few of the samples and then sent the rest to Johns Hopkins to confirm my MS. So yes I have Multiple Sclerosis among other illnesses. But had they not done the spinal tap, the conclusion and need for confirmation would never have happened. MS is an autoimmune disease. There is no cure.

I am 32 years old and have had 3 pregnancies back to back. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism during my 2nd preg with my 2.5 yo daughter. I don't ask a lot of questions and I wish that I did. I was just told my thyroid was not functioning properly and I needed to take 25 mcg synthroid once per day. Done. After my pregnancy I searched for a family doc because mine had moved out of town. I went to one, they did labs, my thyroid was now overactive and they said stop taking the synthroid, you only needed it for pregnancy. Period. I started having gallbladder trouble and they could not take mine out while I was still hyperactive. So the anesthesiologist referred me to her family doc who referred me to an endo. In waiting for my appt my thyroid plummeted. Very very low. I could hardly hold my head off the pilllow. It took 6 months but they finally got me stabilized and then I got preg again. I was unable to afford to keep going to the specialist and my numbers were good so after my pregnancy I started seeing my regular doctor. He has had to make some adjustments to my dose. I'm now on 150 mcg. My numbers at this time are all \"in range\" I don't know what they are as I don't ask a lot of questions but I feel like crap. I have crushing fatigue, aches and pains all over, sometimes my eyesight gets blurry, intolerance to heat, my hair is falling out, I've gained 15 pounds (I HAVE been less active though d/t pain) and there are times when certain parts of my body do not function properly. ex. My hip won't hold my weight or my hand hurts so badly I cannot hold a pen. And horrible headaches that are now controlled with Topomax. My doctor is now suspecting MS and I am going through testing and waiting for an appt with a neurologist. But I have read over and over on here that just because your numbers are \"normal\" does not mean they are optimum and you will be symtom free. Does anyone else have such extreme symptoms with hypothyroidism or do you feel something else must be going on? Also my numbers have been extreme and I know what that feels like so wouldn't that make it less likely to feel so horrible when my numbers are in range? Any opinons appreciated, if you were able to make it to the end, lol "}, "1": {"a": "23151", "t": "I actually take levothyroxine. And if I am completely honest, I am not very consistent with taking medication. You would think with as crappy as I feel all the time it would never slip my mind, but for some reason, it still does. I think I am going to call the hospital on Monday and see if I can get my last results. It's been about 4 weeks ago now. I'm not even sure if they did the Free T3 and T4. But then I will also see about having those labs ran and I will post to see what you think. I THINK she said something was 1.7 but I was also reading a lot of numbers floating around here last night so I'll post again Monday, hopefully with some accurate numbers. Thank you for your reply! "}, "2": {"a": "23151", "t": "Chris- Ha ha. I kept thinking that my TSH was over 100, but told myself, \"that can't be right\" Guess it can be. I know mine is not that right now but it was at one point. Wow, you must have felt really awful being over 500. I do know it is important to take my medication regularly. I also take topomax for headaches and almost ALWAYS forget my evening dose. I keep them in a pill minder on the coffee pot because that is the first thing I do in the mornings. But somehow, sometimes, I still forget. If I get really bad about it I will tell my mom and Grandma who live next door that I have been forgetting and then they will ask me for a few days if I have remembered. I then just take it when they remind me. I'll have to work on that. At this time I am seeing a family physician. I really like him because he takes me seriously but he's not really \"doing\" anything to help me. IDK if there is anything for him to do, that is why I stay. He tells me \"I believe something is going on with you\" but then it's kinda like \"Go home and suffer til the specialists can fit you in\" I am a little bitter right now Sorry. I feel so crappy. All I want to do is go outside and play and I'm not even in a position to force myself to do it because at times, I'm not just too tired, my body won't cooperate! I have a 3 yo, 2 yo, 9 mo. It is pretty inconvenient to have the symptoms I listed above, at times be unable to even walk, and wait around on neurologists and the like for 3 months! lol But like I said before, don't these symptoms seem a little extreme when my numbers are in range, even if not optimum? IDK blech! I'm rambling. I'm not even good company for the internet community right now, lol. Thank you for your reply and that is what I was trying to find out. If people have that pain, eye trouble, etc with hypothyroidism.

Just because my levels aren't way off doesn't mean my symptoms arent way serious. Check. When my TSH was over 100 I couldn't lift my head off the pillow but little else in the way of symptoms. That was in the beginning of my journey. Now they are in range (Don't know how much) but I feel crappy! I just really am not buying into MS or Fibro. I REALLY think I am onto something with my thyroid levels needing work. I sooo wish my husband would come home so that I could make a trip to the hospital. I can request this bloodwrok on my own, I am pretty sure. As long as I pay out of pocket and I don't think it is much. Then I will receive my own results. Chris- It makes me feel good to hear from someone who really does \"get it\". And while people do know something is wrong I think they all feel it is something more serious than \"just my thyroid\" I think you'll understand what I mean when I say it comforts me that you were also suspected of having MS. Because it means you must have had the same symptoms and everything turned out ok. Not that having MS means you're not OK but... I really do need to figure out a way to get better at taking my meds. I've been doing well lately. But I do that for a while and then... well. Thank you both so much and I hope I can get my hands on some numbers soon and that will give us some more definitive answers. Well, you guys anyway. In the meantime, I will be reading because the biggest thing I have learned so far is whether or not this is my problem, I have REALLY underestimated what thyroid problems can do and I have a lot to learn.

You are definitely in a good place to get support. Sammy- It has actually been a little bit since I have missed a pill. A couple of weeks anyway. When I talk about forgetting meds I mean in general. And I am very bad, sometimes a week at a time. But since the MS scare I have gotten better about it. But it is a good idea to wait a couple more weeks before getting them drawn again. And I will have all of them drawn. I will first ask the doc and then pay out of pocket if I have to. Ladybud- I hate to agree that I think something else might be going on too. My doc did run some autoimmune type bloodwork and it came back ok and he gave me a referral to a rheumy I will be seeing Aug 30. He also ran an MRI which was ok and gave me a referral to a neurologist I will be seeing Sept 25. I have had no headaches on the topomax and the blurred vision/vision trouble doesn't SEEM to be connected. I was never dx with migraines and never had headaches until my pregnancies. I do think I need an appt to get my eyes checked. I'm not really all that worried, just frustrated. tkparker- Thank you.

Your body is exhibiting many of the symptoms due to too much Nardil. Look over the list of common and moderate side effects below and tell me what you think on the matter. Nardil is a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Because this enzyme is widely distributed throughout the body, diverse pharmacologic effects can be expected to occur. When they occur, such effects tend to be mild or moderate in severity (see below), often subside as treatment continues, and can be minimized by adjusting dosage; rarely is it necessary to institute counteracting measures or to discontinue Nardil. Common side effects due to over treatment include: Nervous System\u00e2??Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, sleep disturbances (including insomnia and hypersomnia), fatigue, weakness, tremors, twitching, myoclonic movements, hyperreflexia. Gastrointestinal\u00e2??Constipation, dry mouth, gastrointestinal disturbances, elevated serum transaminases (without accompanying signs and symptoms). Metabolic\u00e2??Weight gain. Cardiovascular\u00e2??Postural hypotension, edema. Genitourinary\u00e2??Sexual disturbances, eg, anorgasmia and ejaculatory disturbances and impotence. Less common mild to moderate side effects (some of which have been reported in a single patient or by a single physician) include: Nervous System\u00e2??Jitteriness, palilalia, euphoria, nystagmus, paresthesias. Genitourinary\u00e2??Urinary retention. Metabolic\u00e2??Hypernatremia. Dermatologic\u00e2??Pruritus, skin rash, sweating. Special Senses\u00e2??Blurred vision, glaucoma.

My Ferritin normal of 13 and normal is 10-232 but on the lowest side and I take my iron tablets. My vitamin B12 is 1882 high. I wonder if my Centrum vitamins are doing this. My creatinine is normal but my bun/creatinine is high 39 and highest normal is 22. My urea nitrogen is high of 28 and normal highest is 25. I gained alot of weight too 200 lbs now and used to be 175 lbs. Maybe because of teaspoons of smart balance omega peanutbutter I have couple of times a day to keep my blood sugar normal. It feels like it drops bad but the numbers are in the 90s but feels too low. Ever since I had my gall bladder removed I have sugar problems or maybe the Nardil is doing it which I hear is a sugar eater in the body. Am so sorry I piled all this information to you. Hope to hear from you if you heard anything about Nardil. Thanks QUOTE=mkgbrook;3427251]A TSH of 3 is not normal. . nor is 7.53. Low ferritin causes hypoT symptoms to be amplified. It shouldn't interfere with thyroid med sensitivity though. That is more an immune response. Your thyroid is still under treated. I take it from your comment that the T3 was low. . that there is a large discrepancy between your T4 and T3 concentration. This would indicate that you need T3 supplementation. I have heard of more people having an issue with cytomel as a form of T3 supplementation than Armour or one of its counterparts. But with hypoT levels the jittery/anxious feeling can not becoming from an over dose of thyroid meds. You are most likely looking at your Nardil as the culprit. It also looks like you were severely hypoT. I had depression with secondary hypoT. . and I caught mine early. It is highly likely that the depression that was being treated was a symptom of hypoT and as you get closer to optimal treatment. . the depression meds are affecting you adversely. I am going to look up the pharmokinetic specs on Nardil later and get back to you. MG[/QUOTE] "}, "9": {"a": "20144", "t": "Hi, thanks again for responding and going through all that research. I seen these side effects before but never really thought to put two and two together. I only take one 15 mg tablet a day of Nardil. I hear other people take lots more. I used to be on 2 a day and had to decrease to 1 a day to be able to increase the thyroid meds. Now am on higher dose of SYnthroid I can't lower Nardil anymore being I am only on one a day, so that tells me I have to get off of it totally. I see the symptoms listed below and I do get the tremors, some insomnia, jitters. The jitters start after I take the Synthroid in the morning but got a lot less since I lowered the Synthroid. I feel the Nardil may not be letting the Synthroid do its job. But I feel the Nardil somehow helps stop the jitters. It's so confusing which meds is causing it or maybe both together. The jitters don't start when I take the Nardil. What do you think? << removed >> "}, "10": {"a": "20144", "t": "You're right I should get off the Nardil but am so frightened being they reformulated the Nardil couple of years ago. But I just may have to somehow. Iasked my MD he don't seem to care to help or psychiatrist. I heard of this Richmond Behavioral Associates where I live in Staten Island NY and they put people on antidepressants and wondering if they can help advise me too and what they think too. Youre right I can't live without the Synthroid. More important than the Nardil. Am not on Synthroid for depression. I don't have much of depression. I am on Nardil for panic disorder and Synthroid for hypothyroid only. Unless you're saying being the Synthroid helping with hypothyroid that it helps the depression same time and panic disorder. I see what you mean. Wow can you imagine Nardil like an upper, I don't like that. What I can't understand is after I take Synthroid the symptoms come and I take Nardil 3 hours later and much better. I should get off Nardil. So I guess getting of Nardil try every other day then every third day. I like that better than what someone else told me, He told me go even slow and cut the Nardil in half then in 1/4's. I am nervous opening up Nardil.

I did have panic disorder before I had hypothyroid and sometimes I think those days when I had panic attacks maybe my thyroid turned hyper before turning hypo. Who knows, right? Am not getting panic attacks anymore but I still get anxiety. I don't feel depressed maybe because I am on one Nardil. Yes you're right it is possible my anxiety can be coming from hypothyroid, but I guess we'll find out soon, I hope. I also have alot of environmental allergies too and get little asthma too. Mostly in the throat tho. Anyway, thanks again and talk to you again. "}, "12": {"a": "20144", "t": "Hi, thanks for responding. I learned usually when you're borderline means the doctor wants to wait before they start giving thyroid meds to make sure you're truly hypothyroid. Usually I learned the antibodies in the body attack the thyroid gland before and that's how we end up hypothyroid. I dont know why the body does that. Maybe the same way our bodies react to things in an allergic way. Not sure tho. That's maybe why he didn't treat you right away. I also hate when psychiatrist boom bam put people on antidepressants without getting more detailed blood work, like the full panel of thyroid, any B vitamin or other vitamin deficiencies etc. I learned some B vitamins help with mental health too. Did the doctor or psychiatrist who gave you paxil, did they ever tell you to get full blood work up before they prescribe to you? Mine did. The only thing I don't like about the blood work is that it's not thorough enough. I feel they only test TSH for hypo or hyperthyroid and not the antibodies, t3's and t4's etc. They should also test not just for diabetes but also for hypoglycemia being that can cause anxiety and panic attacks, which is the glucose tolerance test. As far as the glucose tolerance test it would be nice if they came up with a better test for hypoglycemia being you have to sit there and test couple of hours and you eventually your sugar drops but always bring food or drink. I always found that uncomfortable. I bought my own glucometer and did it home. Anyway, am off the subject a little. So I see after you having your kids that the doctor was definitely sure you were hypothyroid then. Did you ask the doctor that didn't want to treat you, did you ask what your TSH blood level was? Anytime I get blood work done, I always ask for the blood test results be mailed to me or pick it up. I want to know what the doctor knows. I had panic attacks and anxiety too before I became hypothyroid, maybe was having it because the antibodies may have been killing off my thyroid, who knows you just never know. You make alot of sense saying that the anxiety was an underlying symptom of thyroid not working properly. I agree on that. What is your TSH now and what dose of Synthroid are you on now? Glad your Paxil not interacting. Imagine no more anxiety and panic attacks when your thyroid levels are normal? That would be great. But anytime you get blood test done, ask for the whole thyroid panel testing. Really, your Paxil was giving you jitters? Were you already on Synthroid? Wow so your Paxil was causing jitters. Wonder if my Nardil is doing to me too. A couple of years ago I couldn't increase my synthroid from jitters and I was on 2 Nardils a day, I lowered it to 1 a day of nardil for the past couple of years, then company reformulates the Nardil and now am scared to lower or try to come off of it. But you know maybe I should try to take Nardil every other day like you said, if only I can get the guts to skip a day on it. Am not sure if I am able to split pill in half, there is no split line on pill. Am nervous opening Nardil tablet cuz of the reformulation. I can always call pharmacist and ask. That would be so nice if I lessen my Nardil and jitters get less. I should try it. There is a website of the new Nardil of complaints. People are saying they change the Nardil to the point where it feels like short acting where you need to take lots more. Maybe I should just stop reading stuff about it.

No, I feel the Nardil is not making the Synthroid work right was my suspicion being that years ago I lowered the Nardil from 2 to 1 tablet actually made me able to increase the Synthroid. But am on 1 a day now for the past 2 years and how low can I go with 1 a day unless I alternate skipping a day. That's what was making me think I the 2 meds together are giving me problem.

Normal is 20%-50% of iron saturation levels and mine was 7% when I was on 150 mcg of Synthroid. Doctors kept ignoring that because all my other iron levels were normal. But lately I saw my Ferritin is low and I am taking an iron supplement now along with my multivitamin/minerals. Still kind of low. It's borderline now. The Synthroid people, Abbott Labs, I talked to on phone said yes the iron and calcium from carbonate does block it but we can take it after 4 hours after taking the Synthroid.

I too believe we as patients and caregivers need to be well armed with facts about health issues. When you wrote about your dog, I thought of mine. My Nipsy (Jack Russell/Toy Fox Terrier) was having seizures. I took her to the vet. He did some blood tests and everything turned out normal so he put her on phenbarbitol to control the seizures. He said to bring her back in six weeks for more blood tests just to check on everything. When I brought her back, the doc said she had hypothyroidism and put her on levothyroxine. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a couple of years ago. I went through several years of not feeling 100%. Then 8 months of HELL before I got even the blood test! I was diagnosed with PMS, depression and cubital tunnel syndrome. Doc rx'd Prozac for the pain of PMS (btw, it worked). The next visit, I was put on Xanax for depression. So I was taking Prozac AND Xanax. And these doctors don't want to rx things that are addictive??? I had every test in the world, I think. Spent 3 days in the hospital testing my heart because I had a racing heartbeat periodically and skipped heartbeats. I went through all of this because the doctor didn't do a simple blood test like my Nipsy's vet did. Nipsy is running around like a new doggie now. No more seizures. Dad was dx'd early on with congestive heart failure. He was very fortunate there. He's been living with it for about 10 years now. My husband had both of his hips replaced. He was 39 with the first one and 44 with the second. Neither of his hips were broken. He had severe degenerative arthritis in both of them. My aunt had hip replacement surgery a couple of years ago. She was schizophrenic. Because of her mental condition, she didn't always do what the doctor said and frequently did what her doctor said don't do. She wound up having to go into the hospital and have the ball part of the joint replaced because she kept bending over and popping the hip out of place. She said it was the worst kind of pain she had ever experienced. She wouldn't do the exercises because they hurt. My aunt died of a blood clot because in her frame of mind, she wasn't capable of keeping up with the doctor's orders. And even caregivers can't be there 24/7 with their eyes wide open.

Housebound since Friday afternoon except for brief walks to do the laundry and get in a few supplies. Mom has been indoors the whole time and it's not good for her. Sleeps too much on her chair while listening to the radio or TV, then is up half the night. Normally on weekends when her Aide doesn't come, I take her out for at least a walk around the block and to eat lunch someplace nearby. Eating out used to be great fun but now it is 'fraught with dangers' . . spilled food, inappropriate noises or comments, sending food back to be reheated after pushing it around on her plate until cold . . (Mom would never dream of complaining in her normal state, would have been too embarrassed!) etc. Then the process of taking off the winter clothes and putting them back on . . I feel like it's an expediton to Alaska, not a walk to the cafe on the corner. But I missed it these 2 days because she needs both the exercise and the change of scene. This AM she told me \"I got a seat assigned for the bus . . seat 42!\" \"what bus?\" \"The bus trip to Atlantic City\". \"Oh no, back to square one!\" Thank God school is not closing tomororw, and I will be 'outta here' and doing my fun job tomorrow. The HHA will be here with Mom whether they go out or not. Mom insists the senior Center is closed, \"they told us on Friday already,\" before anyone knew how much snow would fall, which I do not believe. If she still thinks it's closed she can stay home another day . . or do something else, I will be out for my usual school day (selfish I know but it's my only respite, I'm so grateful I found a job I love when I returned to NY!)

Martha "}, "8": {"a": "1003", "t": "Dear Giz, You have been through the pits. I cannot express my horror at what happened to you and your Mom. My Mom also has congestive heart failure. She became increasingly short of breath until finally in May of 2003 she was gasping for breath even when NOT moving. We took her to the ER and she was kept in the hospital for 4 or 5 days, during which the diagnosis of congestive heart faiure was made. At first she got intravenous drugs, then 6 prescriptions for pills, and was sent home. Her life was saved. She was 94, no one thought she was too old to bother with. The doctor later told us if we had waited until Monday (she had an appt with him for a check up and she did not want to go to the ER on Saturday night) she would have passed away before the night was over. However, her mental symptoms began shortly after that. The doctor took her off one drug, a statin, which was causing leg cramps and (we think) confused thinking. But her fuzzy thinking continued to worsen. I still wonder if there is a connection between the heart failure episode and the memory failure. Mom had lung edema, lots of water in both lungs which was causing the breathing problems, but no water collection in her feet. My grandmother died in 1956 of a massive heart attack at the age of 69 after having had swollen feet for many years . . no one made any connection to heart problems, she was said to have \"dropsy\" .... some old word for edema . . and was not on any heart meds. The doctor removed water MANUALLY, with a needle, from her legs. This was back in the 50s - I was in high school - yet it sounds to me as if your Mom was neglected in the same way as BEFORE such drugs were available. Another relative with Alzheimer broke her hip twice while at a high class nursing home in Florida . . she had AD and was not supposed to get up after the operation . . but got up anyway, fell, and broke the hip again . . maybe this is why they are reluctant to do hip surgery on AD patients, when actually the answer would be \"have her watched 24/7 so she cannot get up!\" Oh Giz, God bless you. I hope you are able to get over your anger and sadness and loss and find joy in life again.

GOOD LUCK. . let us know. . I hope for a joyful heading and not \"frustrated and in tears\"... God be with all of you! I am off work this week, and have to be at my tax advisor in half an hour.

Still a little sore but should be better by the weekend, (and will start Chapter 3 then). Sorry you are not finding time for yourself Sally. I hope Chapter 3 will help you. It will be about setting up your support team. Hopefully this will make it easier for you. You need to find the time for yourself. It's just as much a priority as getting the laundry done or paying the bills or cooking dinner. Get some fast food. Drop off the laundry at a laundry mat. Or, cut your bills down to just one day a month and pay ahead (those that want the money sooner than that) or even 2 months at a time when you can. This should give you some breathing room. And free up at least one day a month. In Chapter 3, I will talk about finding the right kinds of support for you and for your loved one with Alzheimer's. How you need to put your energies into things and outside people that will work with you and not against you. Once you get your support team together, you will save a lot of time, energy and heartache. Depression wastes time as well. So, once you have a plan in place, you will feel a lot better and have a little time to treat yourself. A dishrag in shreads won't dry any dishes. A wet frayed one will only dry a few. But, a new clean cloth will dry many dishes. If you do not have the tools (strength, energy and the rest you need), for yourself? Then how do you expect to take care of someone else? Finding the time is not an option, it's an impareitive, if you plan to be effective. You can not work at your best. You will waste time and not see the forest for the trees. Frustration will lead to bad decisions. I know. I did not make good decisions because most of the time I was so busy playing \"catch up\" that I didn't get the important things done. Yet, on all \"the little, unimportant things\", I dwelled upon them to the point of exhaustion. Hope to write more this weekend (or soon), once my eyes feel better. Hugs to all. Giz "}, "16": {"a": "38188", "t": "Well \"Hi\" Everyone; Hope you haven't forgotten about me. So sorry that I have taken such a long time off. Just been so busy with eye surgery and work and other things, just haven't had the time to get back on board. This morning as I was going thru my email ( belong to several Alz. groups on line), I ran across an artical that really got my blood up. I became as my mom would say, \"Mad as a wet hen\". So, thought that this would be as good a time as any to start \"Chapter 3\" of my long sage. This first two chapters looked at the person with this disease and how you can see this awful disease through their eyes, and how you can change your attitude and the caregiving enviornment to make the care and feeding of an alzheimer's patient more bearable for yourself and for the person with this disease. Chapter 3 envolves the theory that, \"No man (or woman) is an island\", and that you can only be as effective as your support group. One thing that is paticularly important is your team of medical back-up advisors. Getting adaquate medical care and support is totally paramount if you are to succeed in your effort to care for someone properly with this totally distructive disease. The artical I got by way of email this morning was intitaled \"NO MAGIC PILL FOR PROBLEM BEHAVIORS IN ALZHEIMER'S\". Well, I read the artical, and I'm telling you that my little brain got more and more steamed. One of my pet peve's in careing for my mother with this disease is that 1) She never got adaquate medical support and diagnosis, and 2) As a result of this, she never got the medications that she or I needed to get this disease under control. I can not tell you where to find this artical on-line. But, if you do a normal on-line search, you will find it on a popular website for Alzheimer's Information. What I will do here, is to copy and print MY reply to this artical (that I just emailed to their website). I hope that in reading my reply, that you can see the need for and the positive results of: ... the proper and adaquate levels of professionally supported and administered medications for the treatment of behavioral and emotional problems related to Alzheimer's Disease. (For those of you that don't know me, I am an absolute \"MOMMA BEAR\" on this issue. I admite that not all drugs work for all people. And, that different people need different drugs and levels of that drug to be effective. But, to even hint that drugs are not useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease? Well, the little \"Giz\" gets awfully upset about that idea! And, you have a real mad momma bear on your hands ! AND, YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THIS BEAR !) ****************************** I resent, and am personally offended by, your article \"No Magic Pill for Alzheimer's\". I find that this article although informative, (if you read the whole piece in it's entirety), is demeaning to, and counter-productive in stating the need for drug therapy in the care and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The whole tone of this article down-plays the need for, and the importance of behavior modification thru appropriate medications. Alz. is not a disease whereby you can just change your attitude (by yourself), and \"get over it\". It's a serious disease that needs serious medications - at serious enough levels - to be effective. Not only for the person with Alzheimer's Disease to manage their behavior on a day to day basis. But, for the caregivers ability to function from day to day also. I went thru 15 years with my mother where she was either, not diagnosed at all, or where proper diagnosis fell just short of being effective, for her mental, emotional and behavioral problems. Even once a proper diagnosis was obtained, drug therapy was so weak and hard to come by (at an appropriate, effective level), that caring for her was a difficult and sometimes impossible task. Although mom has been gone now for many years, it never ceases to amaze me of who we still are as a society, and where we are, as concerning drug therapy for serious illnesses like Alzheimer's Disease (in this country). We have become so hyper-sensitive to illegal drug usage and drug problems in our society today; that we have become resistant to prescribing legitimate drugs that meet the needs of mentally and physically ill persons in our homes and in our community. Without the proper medications, Alzheimer's is NOT a manageable illness. No more so, than heart disease or Aids. Alzheimer's is not an illness of the mind that one can just simply put on a \"happy face\", and \"think\" one's self \"out of\". It's a serious illness that needs serious treatment and care. Drug therapy is just as vital in that mix as is a pleasant, non-threatening, structured environment, (and an educated, knowledgeable, and caring caregiver). To diminish the importance of drug therapy, (I believe), does a disservice, not only to the patient of Alzheimer's; but, to their caregivers as well. I would say to anyone out there that, if they have a loved one with Alzheimer's, and that if this person still has disturbing behavioral problems, (after intensive or extended doctor's care and treatment), then NOW, \"it is high time to kick THAT doctor to the curb\". And, you should get another doctor who is more cooperative and caring and better equipped to care for someone with a serious disease like Alzheimer's. Not just for the patients sake; but, for the caregiver's sake as well ! Drugs for anxiety, depression, Psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, sleeplessness, anger, night terrors, combativeness, hyper-tension, aggression, and many other behavioral problems are treatable AND MANAGEABLE, thru drug therapy. And, should be treated professionally and aggressively by the care provider and by the caregiver alike. It is not right (in our society and, in this day and age), to have such problems go untreated in an Alzheimer's patient, or in any other patient who may be suffering from a legitimate mental, emotional or physical or physiological illness. Just because our social fears illegal drugs, (their misuse or possible addiction). This fear should, in no way prohibit legitimate drug care for persons in real need of help. We are not in the \"dark age's\" here. This is not the time for the ancient use of \"blood-letting and leaches\". Alzheimer's is a serious medical, physiological, emotional and mental illness. One that requires special medical help and support. Thru drug therapy, (professionally administered and supported) and thru kind, knowledgeable and understanding caregiving, THIS IS THE \"MAGIC PILL\", to the treatment of an Alzheimer's patient. This \"pill\" may NOT \"cure\" this disease. But, it may make it so manageable and livable, (if administered properly and on a daily basis) that a \"cure\" for this disease (even if eventually found), may seam (in the end) to be unnecessary and even anti-climatic. *********************** Well, thanks for letting me get this off my chest. Hope to write more later. Just remember that you are not alone out \"there\". Get the help you need, outside of yourself, to act as your support group and to make your life and your loved one's life, easier and more comfortable and enjoyable. Remember that you only go around one time,,,,make it ... the very best ride possiable. Love to All, Giz "}, "17": {"a": "38188", "t": "Thanks Martha H, I've missed you too ! Hope you are well and happy. Giz "}, "18": {"a": "38188", "t": "Doctors? Someday, I'm going to write a book. . I could write a book about all the \"drug abuse\" that my mom suffered from. And all of it was the abuse of the medications that she should have received and never got. Even when she finally got some help, it was so little, and way too late. When she was placed in the nursing home over a year before she died, and some 6 months or more before she was properly diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She had been misdiagnosed some 10 years of more earlier, as being \"Psychotic Episodial\", or having \"periodic Psychotic events\". She was placed on Thorizine and had been on it for over 10 years. The nursing home required that her Thorizine be removed. (And, any other mind altering, emotionally stimulating medication(s). They called them \"Hal-ou-sin-a-gen-ics\" (?) , and they were not allowed. I had no choice, and no say in the matter. I even tried to contact the state \"assurance nurse\", to get a mandatory visit from a reputable physiatrist to visit and put her on the right medications. They categorically refused. \"NO MIND ALTERING DRUGS ALLOWED\". Within 6 months, mom became incontinent. Had hallucinations. Wouldn't sleep at night and started seeing things. She cried in pain and when she was asked what the pain was and where? She'd just say, \"What pain? I'm not in any pain\". She was bruised all over because she was so combative. She forgot how to read. She stopped eating because food tasted \"so bad\". When I got her home 8 months later, she was in full psychosis. (And bruised over 70% of her body). After the second day of her screaming and yelling that she wanted her mom and wanted to go \"home\", I called mental health and they hospitalized her in the mental ward of the local hospital for 3 weeks. (Court Ordered). That's when she was finally correctly diagnosed with Alzheimer's (very end stage), and given tiny amounts of drugs for that condition. It took a heck of a fight to get those drugs raised to an effective rate -- enough to \"bring her back\" again. Her mental health is one thing. I can partly see why doctors are still in the dark ages over mental health. It is and always has been such a gray area. But, she never got good physical medical medications or help either. In the mid 1980's she fell and broke her hip. She was so afraid of Osteoporosis, because her mother suffered so from it and was bed-ridden the last 3 years of her life. (all her bones just melted away). Mom did get tested and the doctors assured her that she \"was just fine\". Did you know that with pins in your hip you do not qualify for hip replacement surgery? Well, you don't. And, really she wasn't \"fine\" ,,,, she had osteoporosis, and her hip descinagrated. It took over 12 years to cripple her up. All the while the doctors said, \"take aspirin\". 6 months before she died I took her to a bone doctor. She was all lined up to have a hip replacement surgery. I was so excited, she might be able to walk again at last. The week before, the doctor called and cancelled it. Said that mom's doctor poo pooed it. I called her doctor and talked to him. (screamed a lot too). His response was that 1) No doctor will do the surgery because of her being \"senile\" and because of that, she would not cooperate with her recovery process. 2) for medical insurance reasons, the only way insurance will pay for a hip replacement, is if the hip is broken. And, since she had pins in her hip and it was , we needed to come up with $25-30,000 for the surgery as no insurance or Medicare would pay for it. I can not tell you the pain that my mom went thru all her life and especially the last 20 years. Mentally and physically. I knew the year before she died that going to bed, full time, was a death sentence. But, there was nothing I could do. The reason she was in the nursing home is that after she finally had to be put in bed full time because she could no longer walk. (There was no hip joint left for the ball socket to fit into). She rubbed her heals on the sheets so hard (from the hip pain) that she got \"Decubulous Ulcers\" on both feet and had to have \"around the clock nursing care\". She never got her hip surgery. The last 4 months of her life she was on a pain patch. The doctor called it a \"Class A Drug\". Don't know what it was. But \"old sleaze ball\", made me go to his office every 10 days to get an RX for 10 patches. (one a day for 10 days, the maximum he'd allow me, at one time). Had to go in person and get the RX and go to the pharmacy to get the RX filled. (Every ten days). The last week of my mom's life, when I got her into the hospital with the flu. (She was released 5 days later). She was sent home with nursing directives and a request (finally) for hospus. She was dying-he finally admitted it and would at last \"allow\" us to get help for her. I read the nursing directives,,,and both her full time caregiver (Kay), and I sat on the back steps and cried. (I actually screamed out - in pain). The directives gave information of the fatal diagnosis. \"Terminal Congestive Heart Failure\". Frankly, a knife in the chest would have been more kind, at that very moment in time. See, almost a year and a half ago, I took my mom to that doctor for swelling in the feet and ankles that would not go down. I took her 4 times in 3 weeks. All he would do was to raise her blood pressure pill. (or as mom would say her \"p\"\" pill). Now Kay and I knew what that swelling was. It was so very clear,,,now. The hip pain, the swelling that never went away. The scraping of the feet in bed (on blotted little feet that looked like they could burst). Feet that finally put her in a nursing home. THE SWELLING ,,,, one sure sign of ... \"Congestive heart failure\"! (6 months before mom died she started throwing seizure like symptoms. What happens in congestive heart failure? The heart enlarges,,,with the larger heart it becomes harder to function, less heart action,,,,less oxygen to the brain, less oxygen to the brain? You guessed it,,,, MORE ALZHEIMER'S ,,, YEP! Brain needs oxygen, ... you see?) . Here's the real kicker,,,,,My dog? My dog had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure some 3 years earlier ... He was on two pills a day for the condition. Side effect? ,,,,Helped his seizures! They became less frequent and less severe. Also, he needed less and less of his seizure medication when he was put on his heart meds. OK, here's the clincher. (Are you ready for this?) . Because my DOG was on heart meds for 3 years before my mom was even properly diagnosed? He had already gained 3 years. She lived another 2 days after she was diagnosed. After that, My dog? ,,, He lived another 3 years, (after my mom died) That means that my dog got 6 more years on his heart pills than my mom ever got). So, the moral of MY STORY is: \"If your mom's sick,,,get her to a real doctor,,,and if the only real doctor that you know of, is your family vet? Then make sure that she's at least treated as good as your DOG !!! \" Please learn from my mistakes, God Bless, Giz PS: That's why I say, you have to know more than the doctor, you have to be wiser than that specilist. Don't take \"no\" for an answer, find out for yourself ! ,,,and fight ,,,fight,,,,fight...You only have one mom. Giz "}, "19": {"a": "38188", "t": "Dearest Martha, You have been in my heart and in my thoughts now for a couple of days. I was prepared to write a long letter to you about my fathers heart surgery and my ex-MIL's heart surgery. Thank God I don't have to cause I'm really pressed for time this morning. But, just think about heart surgery. Why is \"regression\" so common among heart surgery patients? Some think it's the drugs/or lack of drugs after or during surgery. But think about what really goes on. The heart is stopped and the person is transfered to a heart/lung machine that does the hearts and lungs job (circulation of oxygen thru the body) during the delicate surgery proceedure. How long can the brain live without oxygen? Not long. This is why \"regression\" is so common. It takes a little while (not long, can't) to make the transfer. Most regression symptoms (going back to a simpler world, when they were young, acting or thinking that they are a kid again, having the symptoms of childhood, etc.. , or being \"stuck\" in the past), do not last long. Sometimes a week or two, sometimes just a month. Most times the regression is not perminent. Sometimes when the brain goes without oxygen for too long, the life is saved, but the brain is perminently damaged. (stuck in the past). Get your mom to the doctor and have her blood oxygen tested. Find ways to keep it at a level where the brain is not having to sacrifice living cells to servive. Living Brain Cells that, with Alzheimer's, she can not easily afford to loose. Then find a specilist to keep her blood oxygen at a \"normal\" level (for her age). And, get medications like an Alzheimer's drug to help keep the brain level. Some of the regression can be blood oxygen related, but do not neglect the behavioral and emotionally stabilizing drugs as well. God Bless you for your kind words. You are in my thoughts. There is a special place in heaven for 's like you ! God Bless, Giz Dearest Sally, You go get 'em girl. Be an advocate for your MIL. She can not speak for herself. Remember that you are gaining knowledge along the way and that you are going to weigh everything. Do you homework about her medications. What they are supposed to do, how often, the dosage, how they react with other drugs, are they effective? What is she like just before the drug is given? 1 Hour? 20 min. ? What is she like just after the drug is taken? 20 min? Half Hour? An hour? Does it help the symptoms? How long does it take to be effective? How long does the drug effects last? Sure you will have \"good\" days and \"bad\" days, even on the right dosages. But, keep a chart and check the chart every week to see a pattern of improvement or a pattern of no improvement (or decline). Adjust the medications slowly, and keep the communications open with the doctor for this reason. Get someone who will cooperate with you and not sabbatage your efforts. Do your homework Ask questions. Pay special attention to her blood pressure. Test her blood oxygen levels as well, if necessary. Make sure she's eating right and taking her vitamins. Pay attention to her hygiene. She's not capable of these theing on her own. Little things will cause her to go downhill quickly. Mom stopped washing her hands cause she \"didn't want to get her rings wet\". Eye infections soon started to be a problem. Wonder why? Kinda a \"no-brainer\", huh? Anyway, get your medical ducks all lined up in a row. Get your support team ready and waiting in the wings. Then,,,,, then kick some major league but, and start takeing names, girlfriend!

Congratulations on finding a doctor willing to help you! I'm not familiar with European brands of thyroxine, but I think that's what Eltroxin is. Thyroxine (T4) is the chemical name; Eltroxin a brand name of T4. T4 is dosed in micrograms (mcgs). You may be mistaken about the thyroxine being prescribed at 50 milligrams (mgs). Fifty mgs would be a gigantic overdose... It's never done. Although the dosage is sometimes expressed as . If you are a typical patient, your dose will probably have to be increased in a few weeks. Fifty mcgs is the lowest therapeutic dose there is, and most people need more than that... especially starting out with a TSH where yours is. I must caution you though...

It takes some amount of time to tweak the dose to raise your FT levels enough to be considered optimum for you, and then it takes time for the damage from the low levels to be healed.

If there's any way you can obtain a copy of , by Dr. Alan Rubin, it will educate you on the terminology, treatments, and conditions related to thyroid in an easy to understand way. Best of luck, Amy. I'm delighted we could help! "}, "3": {"a": "17821", "t": "You were correct they have tested my TSh(4.5)and my Ft4(18.8). I ll make sure to get these tests done asap. i also now suspect that this may be the problem of my infertility. Especially since a few months back i got pregnant on my 1st attempt of trying only to miscarry at 7 weeks. I ve now made some research and read that high TSH values cause fertility probs and may also be a cause of miscarriage. Funnilly enough i had no back up from my dr.Who actually said i should only do further testing if i don t conceive within a year. Thank you so much for your help MIDwest. I ll keep you posted .

My Tsh was 7.9(lab range 0.4-4) FT4 was 17.5 (lab range10.3-24.5) All other thyroid result(anti bodies etc) were normal. I had a slightly elevated prolactin level but my endo attributed this to the thyroid prob and diagnosed hypothyroid. I was prescribed 50mgs thyroxine daily. The pharmacist gave me Eltroxin 50mcg tablets. Is this the same thing? Does 50mg and 50mcg represent the same thing? I have to do bloods and see my endo in 6 weeks . Do you think by that time the TSh would have stabilised? What are the chances that i ll need a higher dose to get it stabilised? I most seem like the most naive and impatient person on the world but after a m/c and TTC for more than 6 months getting slightly uneasy now. Thank you so much for your help.

Now the doctor believes that I already had graves disease and my thryoid was in a \"toxic storm\". I had my tubes tied because I never wanted to go through that again. I bought this book on panic disorders - I will find it and let you know the name of it - but in it I found out that the number one reason why we keep suffering from panic is because we let it. I will try to explain that. Once you have a panic attack - it is the worst feeling in the world. You feel like your losing your mind - you get dizzy - you feel faint - you tremble - you are confused - but and remember this - you get scared - really really scared. So when it happens the next time - you get scared and the feelings all come and it scares you even more. Then you become scared of the panic attacks all together. What I learned in this book - is that - panic attacks don't kill you. They don't make you crazy. People don't become out of the blue - crazy. So in this book it taught me to think of it like this - \"yes - I am having a panic attack - I feel really uncomfortable - but it is not going to kill me - nothing bad is going to happen and soon it will go away\". Believe it or not - after I stop giving the panic attacks the power to destroy me - they stopped. Once I started thinking - \"oh here is another one of those panic attacks - no big - it will pass\" - I stopped giving it power over me. They stopped. It was amazing. I had been to doctors - drugged - even had a 24 hour hospital stay in a psych ward - and believe me - once you step foot in a psych ward - you realize how \"not\" crazy you are. But that is what helped me. I will get you the name of the book - I have it somewhere here in my house. Trust me - once you regain power over your panic attacks and not let them have the power - they will stop. I promise. Just remember - they can't hurt you - they are uncomfortable - but once you just admit to that and say you know what \"panic attack - you aren't going to control my life\" - they will go away. I haven't had one in years. And I too was just like you - ready to end my life. I couldn't go anywhere in fear of having an attack- I stayed home for almost one year. I thought I was losing my mind. But I promise to get the name of that book to you and you will learn - just like I did - that once you stop giving the panic attacks power - they go away. I feel so sorry for you - because I was right where you are now. Unfortunately - I had no friends to help me and no doctors that would check my thyroid for imbalances. But lucky for you - you have found many friends - me for one and I will help you every step of the way if you want. Please don't give up - I care about you and want to help. Please reply back to me and in the mean time I will find that book and let you know the name of it. Go buy it immediately. Remember - they are just uncomfortable feelings - and once you stop giving them the power to destroy your life they will go away - I promise. Reply to me ok. I am here for you.

Some other \"hyper\" symptoms occured, too, as soon as I began taking hormone - like insomnia, rapid pulse and heartbeats - but have mostly subsided as my body became used to the meds. I am just guessing, but I suspected that the hyper symptoms came about because I was so severely hypo for so many years, without treatment, that even the small 50mcg Levoxyl I started on seemed too much. I stuck with it, though, because my labs showed that I was NOT hyper, and I still had a lot of hypo symptoms, like dry skin, weight gain, overwhelming fatigue, puffy face and tongue, and a host of others.

Not knowing much (if anything) about the medications etc you are speaking about, as I am only on Thyroid meds it would be prudent for you to search it out. But I bet others here would be able to guide you with your questions. I heard about it on this board, and thought about it, and out of the blue a very knowledgable friend and health minded to boot, mentioned that she and her husband (who has recovered from Hep C) are on this...she is a TD patient as well, and is on Armour. I bought after researching, this stuff in Wal Mart (you can get it on the net, prob for cheaper, but I live in Canada and would not wish to try buying stuff that way) I do know however, that it has not hurt me, nor anyone else for that matter. One thing I read though, is it must (or should) be Tonalin CLA and only from safflower and no 'safflower/sunflower and do search out on google.... a few of us here, are really loving it. I take 4000mg a day for fat burning, and it targets first the abdomen (so it says) and I am hoping it jump starts my dead metabolism. My friend told me it only works this fast (I have not seen it work on me yet) but only am into 10 days so far) for a period of 2 months, but her hubby who is on meds for the Hep C he had years ago when in the military service overseas, and he has lost 14 pounds since January 1st.

Maybe it is the CLA making me become normal with activity (sweatys) I like to think it is the old Bonnie seeking away to come to light again after all these years.....

"}, "1": {"a": "3258", "t": "I think the reason most of us found the \"you're normal\" statements to be hard to relate to was mainly due to the fact that our \"normal\" (aka in-range) levels were anything but our normal. Doctors have become so hung up on numbers that they tend to ignore symptoms. Before thyroid testing became available, doctors medicated based upon symptoms with the goal of complete symptom elimination. Now, they look at in-range labs and tell us we are \"normal\". Thankfully, some doctors (including my current one) recognize that each of us has his/her own normal within the normal ranges. I know that my previous doctors would have freaked about my top-of-the-range levels that I need to be symptom-free.....they'd be telling me I was going hyper - especially since my Graves' blocking antibodies keep my TSH suppressed. If my levels are in the normal range, I'm \"normal\" - right, Doc? "}, "2": {"a": "3258", "t": "I think it's great that a doctor tracks FreeT4 levels - hopefully, the information is used to identify your personal best level. Even though my doctor is quite thyroid-savvy, it didn't seem like she did this for me but, I did it and she respects what I've determined are my optimal levels. Now, I would hope your doctor also tracks your FreeT3 level since T3 is the active hormone. Many people develop problems with converting T4 (storage hormone) into T3 since 20% of this happens in the thyroid. Well, a sick thyroid that already needs T4 stands a good chance of not converting well, either. Most definitely, it's a combination of symptoms validation and identifying optimal levels. Unfortunately, all too many doctors are too quick to dismiss symptoms to anything but the thyroid.

First of it will not go away, and second of all with all the syptoms i was having usually they would find the goiter on not only just an ultrasound but was discouraged him most was that he could feel it.

There are big differences between brands of t4. They have the same active ingredient but it's the ingredients that can make all the difference in the world. The fillers and binders can affect how well the t4 is absorbed in your body. Also, if you take your meds on a full stomach, they won't be absorbed as well either. I was horrible on synthroid and when I switched to the Mylan brand levothyroxine, I felt much better. Btw, I was dx'd hypothyroid when my TSH was 8.6. Six weeks later, it went down to 5.6. Six weeks after that, it went up to 37. And I was feeling better when it was 37 than when it was 5.6. If you have Hashi's, I think the antibodies count has a lot to do with it.

The further along you are in your journey, things will all settle in and it will be second-nature for you. Truly, though, you need to avoid ALL calcium within 4 hours of your levo. A recent study showed that levo is better absorbed when taken at night (around bedtime but it's best to take it the same time at night if bedtime isn't consistent). The thought behind the better absorption rate is that bowel motility is slower at night - there definitely isn't any food/drink interfering (unless someone has munchies in the middle of the night - lol) and more conversion happens at night. Since I love my AM coffee, I've been taking my levo at 11PM each night. Levo has a long half-life and some people do need to take alternating doses (as in 88mcg/100mcg) to maximize their levels. Now, when we take thyroid hormone replacement meds, we are trying to compensate for inadequate thyroid hormone production. Our bodies need ever-changing amounts of thyroid hormone to function properly. For example, when we are sick or stressed, we need more hormone. Well, our meds dose is static. Common sense tells me that it's better to take the same dose every day, if possible.....I just don't see merit in taking hormone one day and taking nothing the alternate day. The more consistent we are with things that affect thyroid function, the more stable our thyroid hormone levels will be. Stable thyroid hormone levels feel MUCH better than changing thyroid hormone levels. I think you're correct in taking 12.5mcg every day.

The only thing that *might* help increase your FreeT3 level would be a 100-200mcg yeast-based selenium supplement. Selenium is a vital part of the T4/T3 conversion process so, supplementing with it just might help things along.....2-3 Brazil nuts/day is another idea (Brazil nuts contain a lot of selenium) Any chance you could get your doctor to let you try Erfa? That's a natural thyroid product made from porcine thyroids and contains both T4 and T3. I'm still liking you sharing those books with the doctor (and maybe the pharmacist) "}, "6": {"a": "3258", "t": "\"Normal\" (aka in-range) levels aren't good enough....they need to be YOUR normal. Many symptoms of hypothyroidism mimic the symptoms of other diseases, including MS. My doctor had me get a brain MRI to rule out MS when I told her about the brain fog I had (which was due to thyroid hormone levels that were too low for me) It would be to your benefit for you to identify the FreeT4/FreeT3 levels at which you feel best...these are called setpoints. You'd want to keep track of your labs/meds dose/symptoms so you can \"hone in\" on your optimal levels. For most of us, this means levels in the upper third of the range. It's entirely possible to feel well by having thyroid disease but, it takes work to identify our optimal levels and be proactive with our dosing to maintain them.

My doctor kept my dose the same and I am SO glad she did 'cuz my FreeT4 level dropped 4 wks. after I started Cytomel in January - my levo dose has been increased each month since then and my FreeT4 level is finally where it needs to be. My experience is not uncommon - you can read threads on here with similar stories. Cytomel can be taken with anything. Most of us divide our dose into 2/day.....in the morning and approx. 6 hours. later. This practice recognizes the short half-life of Cytomel so, it reduces the chance of hyper symptoms after the dose....and keeps the patient's thyroid hormone levels more steady throughout the day - that feels better. Please know that, if you are going to have any side effects, they will most likely occur within 3-4 days after starting Cytomel. Some people lower their dose and ease in more slowly. Best of luck to you! "}, "10": {"a": "3258", "t": "So sorry to hear of your struggles!! Unfortunately, many people have trouble adjusting to Cytomel. It's not uncommon to have both hyper and hypo symptoms as we adjust to meds.

Maybe the endo will be receptive to Erfa? Some people are able to adjust to the natural T3 more easily. Sorry, but, I don't know enough about your other issues to comment. And, believe me, I think we can all relate to being tired of feeling sick and tired. "}, "11": {"a": "3258", "t": "Many of us split our 5mcg tabs into quarters as you are planning to do....and we took 1/4 tab (1.25mcg) in the AM and 1/4 (1.25mcg) 6ish hours later. Then, if we fared well after a week or so, we'd try the full 5mcg. Now, some people couldn't even handle that....I think a lot depends on how much their FreeT3 level needed to increase. The larger the necessary increase, the harder the adjustment. My doctor kept my levo (generic synthroid) dose the same when I started Cytomel. My FreeT4 level dropped after that and I've had to have my levo dose increased several times to get my FreeT4 level back where I need it to be. My situation is not unique. You see, T3 is like 4 times as potent as T4 so, when the body senses more hormone, it reduces the production of TSH. Well, less TSH means the thyroid isn't being as stimulated to produce hormone so, less stimulation means less hormone...which means lower FreeT4 level. You do need to be taking Cytomel for a full 2 weeks for your labs to accurately reflect what the dose accomplished. So, if at all possible, stay on whatever dose you take for that amount of time before labs. Hope you feel better sooner rather than later!

Your FreeT4 level dropped from a pretty good level to the bottom of the range. And, even with starting Cytomel, your FreeT3 level dropped from the lower part of the range to being under-range. I don't understand why you would cut back on your Synthroid dose - it's clear you need an increase. And, you really need an increase in your Cytomel dose as well. It's a good idea to try to get both the FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels to at least mid-range and then adjust your meds dose until you are without symptoms....this will most likely \"land\" you at the upper half/upper third of the range. Mid-range for your FreeT4 is 15.25 and for your FreeT3, it's 5. Please know that people who are medicated properly usually have TSH < 1 and, people taking T3 meds such as Cytomel often have suppressed TSH. Must admit, while I'm happy to hear you're feeling a bit better, I'm completely surprised since your labs do show that things have worsened significantly Maybe it's good that your TSH shows significant hypothyroidism at this point so the endo will definitely take notice and adjust your meds doses - both in an upward direction.

I'm wondering if we had similar experiences. (in other words, the FreeT4 level was in a good place but, the FreeT3 level was too low....\"overdosing\" on Synthroid/levo in cases like this doesn't necessarily help) I'm just having trouble figuring out how you wound up taking 50mcg Synthroid..... And, I wonder if the iron made things \"problematic\". Some people have had trouble with their thyroid meds when adding iron - even when they took it 4 hours apart from their meds. They had a decrease in the efficiency of their meds. Just some thoughts... Best, Sammy "}, "15": {"a": "3258", "t": "Thanks for putting your story all together here. Doctors certainly don't help matters, do they? Going to 150 was a big jump, especially when it was clear you needed T3 instead - no wonder you crashed - so sorry you endured this. I understand the progression of things - not feeling well at all - doctors not helping - trying to figure things out on one's own, desperate to feel better. We had a mantra on my first-ever thyroid forum: Slow and steady wins the race. Some of us learn this the hard way and it's so unfair that your doctors did that to you. For whatever it's worth, I learned something the hard way in regards to lab frequency. Even though my quite \"with-it\" doctor had me get labs 4-5 wks. after a levo (generic Synthroid) dose increase, telling me that they are accurate, my research points otherwise. It takes 6 wks. for a change in T4 dose to reach steady state in the bloodstream and 8 wks. for full \"body recalibration\" (in other words, 8 wks. for all body systems to adjust to the new dose). Of course, I wanted to believe my doctor since her news was better than my research . Well, awhile back, I had my usual labs 4 wks. after a dose increase and my levels were just where I needed them to be. Yet, I wasn't feeling that great....within 2 wks., I things went downhill. By the time of my next labs 4 wks. later, my levels had settled in and they were a lot lower. So, \"interim\" labs 3 weeks after a T4 dose adjustment really don't tell the truth. And, while we can accurately check the FreeT3 level 2 wks. after a Cytomel dose adjustment, we still need a full 6-8 wks. to see how the Cytomel adjustment might have affected the FreeT4 level (all part of that \"full body recalibration\".

I'm not 100% clear as to how much Cytomel you are taking (3/4 of what?) . But, many of us (including me) started with 2.5mcg/day (divided into two doses). Then, if doing well after a week, increased to 5mcg. Then, we would stay on the same dose for 6 wks. until labs since it takes at least 6-8 wks. for everything to settle in. It wouldn't make sense for you to get labs now since you haven't been on either dose long enough for them to accurately reflect in levels. Again, I don't think you are truly hyper - you are experiencing hyper symptoms that many people have when starting Cytomel or increasing the dose. It makes sense at this point to either lower the Cytomel dose or stop it all together. Then, stay on your 75mcg Synthroid for 6 wks. and get labs.

It's very helpful to see where you've been to properly advise you moving forward and, so many things were discussed within the context of this thread that I just wanted to make sure my memory was correct. Your thyroid hormone levels back on July 5th were very hypothyroid - both your FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels were below-range. The fact that you've gone through SO many dose changes over a relatively short period of time really didn't help matters. Moving thyroid hormone levels do NOT feel good as you are experiencing right now. Since your levels have to go up SO much now, I understand why you are having such hyper symptoms. Slow and steady wins the thyroid disease race. I think you should really consider my most recent suggestion....go back down to 2.5mcg Cytomel (divided into two doses/day) or stop it for now, and keep with the 75mcg Synthroid....no more dose changes. Then, get labs at 6 wks. and decide on things from there. Your body needs a break - it needs a chance to adjust to each dose before changing things up again. Unfortunately, you do have a longer road in front of you since we have to give each dose at least 6 wks. to \"show its stuff\".

Actually, your FreeT3 level looks too low and maybe that's the reason you don't feel so well.

I'm not sure if your questions here about Erfa will be noticed by the people most likely to have answers.

"}, "22": {"a": "3258", "t": "Happy to hear your nutrient, etc. issues are resolving - yay!!! Now, the symptoms you are describing (including inability to walk) are hypo symptoms....severe hypo symptoms. Unfortunately, the longer our thyroid hormone levels are too low for our body's needs, the larger the number of symptoms we can develop and the greater the intensity. The symptoms will only get better with proper treatment. And, as we titrate up on our doses, the symptoms will sometimes worsen and/or new ones could develop. The best thing we can do is keep adjusting our doses until our FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels get above mid-range.....and then continue to adjust our doses until the symptoms resolve. I will tell you this much - the closer you get to your optimal levels, the less \"dramatic\" the symptoms become. Now, your most recent labs showed a definite need for more T3 (and also more T4) . Please know 60mg Erfa isn't a high dose at all....it contains 38mcg T4 and 9 mcg T3. Since T3 is like 4 times as potent as T4, your 60mg Erfa dose is pretty much equivalent to your current 75mcg Synthroid dose (without considering your Cytomel dose) Now, some people respond better to natural thyroid so, your starting Erfa dose is quite appropriate. I'd be inclined to start Erfa exactly as the doctor prescribed. If you start out lower, you will be heading backwards Please know that, based upon your recent labs, you will most likely need a dose increase by the time of your next labs....and, you might need to add some Synthroid to your regimen. Natural thyroid such as Erfa contains proportionately higher amounts of T3 than T4 compared to human thyroid. This often results in a proportionately higher FreeT3 level compared to FreeT4 level. Some people are OK with this.....others need to add Synthroid to balance things out. Since I need both my FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels at the very top of the range, I'd be one of those people that would need to add Synthroid to my Erfa to be symptom-free.

She recommended the one I see now and she and the other docs are great. She does not discount my fibro and other autoimmune problems in the equation. When I complained of not feeling right to the first endo, she blamed everything on fibro or auto immune problems. My thyroid numbers were 'within range'. You know with armour your labs will be up and down, because it is a natural and sometimes it will have more T3 and sometimes it will have more T4. I think the trick is to be consistent about it. It could take months for you to get stable. As I said I take 120mgs. one day and 90mgs. the next.

Best regards. -h "}, "1": {"a": "78380", "t": "Hi Vickie - My psychiatrist once told me that those who have panic/anxiety disorder (which, I believe he said is a chemical imbalance in the brain) have it from birth. People who have panic/anxiety can go through their childhood, teen years, etc....and then something very stressful that happens to that person triggers the first panic attack. For instance, my first panic attack was triggered by a skipped heartbeat that I felt out of nowhere when I was 18. On the other hand, I have a brother who is 18 years older than I am and he didn't have any problems with panic/anxiety until he felt a tightness in his chest at the age of 50. So, what I'm trying to say is that those of us who have anxiety/panic disorder are born with this chemical imbalance (or maybe chemicals change as we get older...I'm not quite certain) and then something stressful or very scary happens to us and then our bodies react with panic. Once you have that first panic attack you become a nervous wreck because you wait anticipating the next attack. I, too, have an under active thryoid. I take .125 mg. of Levoxyl every day. When I first started having problems with my thyroid...it took me a couple of years to start feeling \"normal\" again. My thryoid disorder didn't effect my anxiety but, just like you, I had crying spells, depression, I was very easily distracted, when I would talk I'd forget what I was saying mid-sentence, I was fatigued, I gained 60 lbs....I really thought that I was losing my mind!! It's been 4 years since I was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and I bet it was 2-3 years before I felt somewhat normal again. Don't let my experience scare you...I know people who are given the correct dosage of medication for their thyroid problem and come out of it very quickly. This is only a suggestion but have you ever thought about going to a psychiatrist concerning your panic/anxiety problems?? I tried working with my Internist to get a handle on my anxiety for years but I didn't get true relief until I went to a psychiatrist. Vickie, I really hope you find peace very soon!

I have this constant tension in the back of my neck now - not a headache but always feeling like it might be one. I know it is stress - and that doesn't help the adrenals or the thyroid - so what in the heck do you do about it when you don't feel good - hard to put it out of your mind...... I would love to know how to do that. I said today - maybe this is how I am going to feel forever - so \"get used to it\" and go on with life. Even that makes it hard to want to do much.

Then you'd take your other meds. I heard recently, the FDA is reducing potency again, second time since 2000, I believe, and probably you've all noticed, the Labs take a very long time to change their forms when \"normal\" TSH has been lowered. It's now .3 to something, right? But they still have 3 or maybe even 5 as normal range on forms. We all seem to have extreme tiredness, and I wonder if some of that isn't due to inadequate thyroid medication. Has anyone asked? If you're on a little higher does, for instance levothyroxine 300, and I heard of one person on 500, and still have symptoms, all but two of the two or three pages of hypo symptoms, usually you can't find a doctor who's prescribe more than even 200, much less increase elderly peoples' 300. We would be a little afraid of it too. They seem to fear it damages the heart, but one day I overheard a patient in the hallway being admitted to a hospital with a too-slow heart rate, 2 seconds or more between heart beats. Her husband was telling the doctor she was always cold when he was burning up. It seems to be typical of hypo's that they don't even think to tell their doctors these things. So what's the truth? It's almost impossible to find a doctor who'll not keep making you nervous about this one med. Mine just added Atenolol, which I've been protesting a long time, finally bought one month's supply, only $6, and cut a pill in half. I had some pain and burping, as if the heart was changing gears or something, can't think of a better description. I was frightened and drank a whole bottle of water to try to dilute it, know a drugstore with a machine where I can check my heart rate, and I don't plan to take it often if at all. I went in yesterday to complain of tiredness so bad I sometimes have to take aspirin for it, have had a lot of laser recently for retinopathy, have six weeks to recover before any more of it, also had a foot ulcer infection. I think my doctor's entirely too impulsive, insisted on putting me on this w/out apparently knowing it causes even more tiredness. A pharmacist verified he should have done some tests. He's still having trouble with the language here, and I'm looking for someone for second opinions or to be my regular doctor, who'll be smart enough to understand Dr. Lowe, that best TSH level isn't always the same for all patients. I need mine low, .1 or lower. But the gov't keeps reducing the potency. By the time we resort to something like thyrolar probably it'll become hard to get that too? Worst case scenario. Anyone good at educating doctors about thyroid? Some say they only studied it a few minutes. Also a few other subjects. They never seem to look up side effects of prescriptions. I always double check online and maybe with knowledgeable pharmacists. I'm a senior, slightly asthsmatic, very diabetic, take Lisinopril for b.p., pletal for circulation, metformin er and Glipizide, plus otc decongestants which the allergist told me can cause rapid heart beat. She didn't say if it's dangerous or could be left alone. I'm just now looking it up online. Thanks so much to all of you for reporting your experiences.

My story's a bit different. I've had thyroid symptoms for YEARS (fatigue, weight gain, irregular/nonexistent periods, brain fog, head hair loss but excessive hair growth in other areas like face, joint pain, anxiety) but these were also symptoms of plycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis (which I'm also diagnosed with). The symptoms got gradually worse over the years but REALLY escalated in the last three, just before my miracle daughter was born. Again, when the symptoms got worse, I blamed it on the pregnancy, being a new mother, my job, yada yada yada. In early June of this year, I saw my OB to start back on fertility drugs to try for miracle #2 when he noticed a lump in my neck. After an u/s (the largest of my MANY growths were 4.4, 3.6 and 2.5 cm) and positive biopsy for cancer, I had TT on June 30th. My entire thyroid (measuring a mere 11 cm across) was FULL of cancer, and it had spread to at least 3 lymph nodes. They think it's been growing for years. I have had minor swallowing problems for the last 2, which I know now was a symptom I shouldn't have ignored. I finished my first RAI treatment of 200 mci a little over a month ago.

If we had known your doctor planned on starting you on Armour without labs beforehand, we would have cautioned you against that. I think your doctor's meds titration process was just too much, too soon. Hindsight can truly be 20/20. While your FreeT3 level was high in the range after starting Armour, your dose was reduced so, you should be more comfortable. Moving thyroid hormone levels just don't feel good. So, even if we make an appropriate dosing decision, we can still wind up dealing with symptoms until our levels have been optimized. I guess at this point you need to decide what you want to do.....and stick with it for at least 6 wks. so you can get accurate labs.

You posted them just as I do it....date and dose at time of labs with lab info underneath. (I always note the ranges as well since labs do change their ranges. I've been using the same lab for almost 5 years and they changed their ranges twice) I also put a quick note about how I'm feeling. Now, during the meds titration process, I also maintained a separate, daily journal. I chose to note certain things that were significant to my experience with thyroid disease such as: sleep quality, digestion quality, energy/strenth/stamina, hair loss, etc. I also noted any unusual things that might have been going on in my life that could have played a part in how I felt. Of course, I noted my labs and meds dose as they applied to the journal entries.

It was quite liberating for me to realize I no longer needed to keep the journal which was about 3 months after my levels were optimized. It's really too bad you don't have earlier FT4/FT3 results so we can see if you were converting all along.

In looking at your most recent labs, your FT3 is 10% of range and your FT4 is 30% of range and that's with you taking T3 in the form of Armour. With you taking 50mcg levo and 15mg Armour at the time of these labs, your equivalent dose was 59.5mcg T4 and 2.25mcg T3. It's clear your FT3 level needs more help than your FT4 level....it doesn't look like you're converting well. I will not deny that I like the idea of a small T3 dose increase based upon your low FT3 level....the only way to increase your T3 dose would be to increase your Armour dose. Quite frankly, I'd be inclined to try the 30mg Armour and keep the levo at 50mcg. This would result in an equivalent dose of 68mcg T4 and 5mcg T3.

If you are more comfortable with the levo dose increase, try it....it will be the only way to know whether or not it will be enough to convert the T4 to T3. You just never know - you might wind up on 75mcg levo and 30mg Armour (or more of either/both). There's a good chance this didn't work previously because it was too much too soon. Unfortunately, when stuff like this happens, people are reluctant to go back on \"older\" doses that \"didn't work\". If you see merit in my idea about the Armour dose increase, you might consider dividing the dose into two/day.....this will help ease any \"impact\" you might feel from the higher T3 dose.

There are many people that say they feel better on Armour compared to how they felt on synthetics. While most people can convert T4 to T3, many can't. 20% of conversion happens in the thyroid.

Now, your FT4 is at 40% of range and your FT3 is at 42% of range so, you definitely need to do something with one of your meds. Since Armour has both T4 and T3, I'm thinking it might be better to ask your doctor to first increase that so you can definitely get your FT3 level higher and somewhat improve your FT4 level. Then, if you get to the point that only your FT4 level needs help, you could ask for a levo dose increase. "}, "20": {"a": "3258", "t": "Most definitely....slow and steady wins the race. "}, "21": {"a": "3258", "t": "If you think you are feeling 100%, I suggest \"wearing\" your current levels a little longer to make sure the 100% lasts. If you opt to stay the course, I suggest labs in 3-4 wks. to make sure those levels \"stick\". Your TSH is higher than what people optimally medicated on any form of T3 will have. (in this case, TSH is suppressed) This could mean your FreeT4/T3 levels could use some improvement. Most people need both the FreeT4/T3 levels to be 60-80% of range so you can see that your FreeT4 level is just below mid-range and your FreeT3 level is around 60% of range. If you have any symptoms whatsoever, I'd be inclined to go for a small levo dose increase since your FreeT4 level is proportionately lower in the range than your FreeT3 level. An increase of 6.25mcg - 12.5mcg tops seems appropriate. In fact, since slow and steady is really the best, a 6.25mcg increase might be all you need. This would mean taking alternating doses of 50mcg and 62.5mcg. This would increase your FreeT4 level a bit and, hopefully via conversion, increase your FreeT3 level a bit as well. Please also know that sex hormones can affect thyroid hormone levels so, yet another reason to stay on top of thyroid labs. Best of luck to you moving forward!!

"}, "23": {"a": "3258", "t": "Since your labs showed room for improvement, I think you can safely use the jaw ache as your indicator.....this time. Please remember that symptoms can be confusing, labs don't lie. I thought achy knees was my trademark hypo symptom (one of the first to develop). It seemed like achy knees were the story of my life during the meds titration process. However, one time after my levels were optimized, I developed achy knees about 3 days before my labs. It turned out that my FreeT4 level went a bit higher than usual. A small levo dose decrease put an end to those achy knees within days. I now realize that it's achy knees *after* afternoon fatigue sets in that can be hypo for me but, achy knees as a first symptom *might* be hyper. Thankfully, my levels haven't strayed much since they were optimized so I haven't had many opportunities to experience hyper symptoms that occur as a result of meds (they do seem different than the hyper symptoms I had from Graves' hyperthyroidism) Clear as mud, I know. I share this with you only to emphasize that we all need recent labs to justify any dose adjustment during the meds titration process- otherwise, we're at risk of a longer ride to get to our goal and this means more symptoms for a longer period of time. Once levels are optimized, it's really up to the individual and the doctor to decide on appropriate lab frequency. My doctor prefers that all her thyroid patients get labs every 8 wks. I prefer to avoid symptoms. Since I've never been on the same dose for more than 4 months, my doctor has me get labs every 6 wks. The two times my levels moved from optimal, a small dose adjustment limited my symptoms to 1-2 extremely minor ones that lasted a few days. Whatever works best for the individual. "}, "24": {"a": "3258", "t": "I'm glad you were able to figure things out. I think this stuff is beyond most doctors' level of comprehension because only those of us living with thyroid disease understand the clear as mud issues lol I've always had what I call a delayed reaction to my levels to the extent that I didn't feel my levels until usually after they \"hit\". This does make sense when you think about the fact that a lot is going on behind the scenes as the body adjusts to new levels of hormone. The body has to decide if the new levels are here to stay all the while trying to allocate hormone to the various parts of the body that have varying needs for it. If the body did this quickly, a healthy person would vacillate between hyper and hypo symptoms. Instead, the slower process goes on behind the scenes and the person is usually able to go about his/her business with no clue. I've been taking thyroid hormone since March 2010 and it still seems like I'm learning. I didn't learn my \"high-end\" FT4 until October of last year and it was February of this year before I learned my \"high-end\" FT3. Obviously, my doctor never overmedicated me and I don't consider the relatively recent small dose reductions that were needed to be a sign that she erred with her dosing decisions. My body had changed so my needs for thyroid hormone changed. I expect to be dealing with stuff like this for the rest of my life. No biggie as long as I continue to feel well.

I'm back because I have run face first into a wall again and I'm not sure where else to turn. Heck, I'm not even sure this belongs entirely on the thyroid board, but I figured I'd start back in my old stomping grounds. Sorry if this is long, it's been a really trying 3 weeks. The story: I'm hypo. My dose was stable for roughly 8 months (90mg Armour, 50mg Levothyroxine). I went for a checkup, and routine blood work on November 2nd. A few things were noticed in the blood work. 1 - My thyroid levels were low and unstable again (I don't have the numbers this time, the lab screwed up the test and only did a T4. I just haven't picked up the results yet) Regardless, my doctor upped my Levothyroxine dose to 75mg because I've been very symptomatic. 2 - My iron levels were off the chart high. My doctor thought this was rather odd considering I'm a menstruating female (I'm 25), I'm not on any vitamins, and I only eat red meat usually once a week. 3 - (not related to blood work) She put me on a beta blocker because of my excessive migraines. Towards the last week in October I had 5 migraines in one week. She put me on propranolol. To make a long story short, after visiting the ER for chest pains and palpations I went off the beta blockers, because they found an arrhythmia in my heart. ------------ So, ok. I'm finally over the side effects from the propranolol, and to be honest I feel even worse than I did last month. I'm just, so tired. I have been dozing on and off every day, can't get enough sleep, etc. The research I've done suggests it's more common to have low iron levels and be hypothyroid. Also, from what I've read it's common for hypEr patients to be put on beta blockers. *sigh* I'm worried about what she did to me. I could really use some advice and direction with all of this.

It determine that i have low testosterone so he started me taking HCG for a while that increase my testosterone level , however thyroid symptoms still their , my major concern is muscles and joint pain and weight gain, lack of exercise tolerance. Recently he tested Rt3 , it came out following test results FT3= 3.84( 200-4.2) RT3= 394 (100-350) TT4- 9.6 TSH 1.10 He said my hypo symptoms are because of high RT3. He started me taking 5mcg of Cytomel in the morning and 5mch of cytomel in the afternoon after 7 hours but didn't stop my t4 88mcg levoxyl. Question that i have for board. 1. I have read on order to clear Rt3 , i have to completely stop T4 medication for 12 weeks and only on T3 med . Is this true. Am i increasing more symptoms if continue taking T4 along with T3 ? . As i am not feel more worst now. My body is not functioning well. 2. Is my sex symptoms can also be because of thyroid symptoms or i have hypogonadism ? . I am taking now clomid 50mg /day and almost finish taking HCG as my LH and FSH were low so he thinks stop HCG and take clomid will help. But if my thyroid is corrected completely i am assuming my sex hormones started to function same way as before , what do you think ? 3. Please share all your stories with me , as i need some moral support it is being 6 years dealing with thyroid symptoms and not going anywhere. I am just 40 but feel like 80 . i need to be around for my daughter. Addition: I want to add few more things in my post to provide some more detail. I used to low normal Iron level /B12 . It is corrected now my Ferritin is now 174 (40-400). B12 600 (200-860). IN order for optimum thyroid result those two element has to be corrected so they are fixed. IN my recent test my cortisol is 6.5 ( 6.0-18), very low so i am taking now HC 20mg /day. Please reply to my post , i am extremely anxious to see responses , even yo don't have an answer for me , please reply with your symptoms and experience , trust it will increase my moral support.

Do you think my TSH should be lower 1, for that i need to increase my T4 to 125mcg of Levoxyl and 10mcg of Cytomel , i believe this will bring my T4 to high of range and Ft3 also in high range.

It is overflowing - wish I could come to California and help you out. Hope you all get better soon. Glad your hubby quit smoking - hope it lasts!! Didn't you crash last week too - was it ever any better? I think you needed an increase instead of a change of meds. I have been told they like to keep you on the same dosage when they change brands for at least 4-6 weeks. They only up your meds on the same brand. I assume the dosage is the same for Synthroid as for Levoxyl (50 mcg). Changing brands - for a reason I can't figure out, sometimes causes problems at first. I guess it COULD be the fillers. Also, I read that Synthroid \"spikes\" theirs to make sure it doesn't lose its potency quickly, so you could be taking a higher doseage without knowing it. It didn't bother me from Levothyroxine - Synthroid - Levothyroxine at the same dosage. A dosage increase or decrease also can. Also, stress plays a HUGE part in how we feel - and you certainly have more than your share of that. I believe you have FM too - and that all by itslef with the stress can cause a lot of your symptoms. Massage works VERY well for me - my hubby is great at it. I also take nice long warm baths - I wonder how you could work that out with your family - as I remember barely being able to get a quick shower in sometimes. Do you take anything like selenium or magnesium? I think they have both helped me a lot. I take 50 mg selenium and the RDA?? of magnesium. The selenium supposedly helps convert the T4 to T3. I don't know what \"mood drugs\" are. Maybe the anti-anxiety drugs could help you until everything settles down. 12 year old girls are dealing with the hormone thing too, just differently. Try giving her things to do to help you, if she has been \"trained\" at all and praise anything she does - even if it isn't up to your standards. Might help. I gave a GD some old makeup I bought thinking I might try wearing it(never did) and let her experiment. Made her feel more \"grownup\".

Doctors usually don't start people on that low of a dose unless there are other medical issues like heart disease also. I'm curious what the labs and ranges are for both of you. I had a terrible time when I was first dx'd and put on meds. I started on Synthroid 50mcs. I wound up having to switch to the generic because it worked better for me. My body tends to react better with the Levothyroxine I'm taking now. I'm on 125 mcgs. Your body is getting something it desperately needs but is accustomed to not getting. It's a big adjustment. It's also very possible that you're not getting enough t4 (Synthroid) which is what I'm suspecting with the low dose you're both taking. It takes 4-6 weeks and sometimes a bit longer for the meds to get fully into your system. You'll probably go through more weird stuff before you start feeling better. Try not to worry. It get better.

Your high blood pressure should have flagged you as at risk and in need of close monitoring on levothyroxin/levoxyl/synthroid. There are many other medicines that can affect levothyroxine. These includes vitamins, minerals, herbal products, and drugs prescribed by other doctors. The biggest flag in the data base is BP medications. BP medication is known to interact adversely with the thyroxine. In particular lithium, amiodarone, iodine treatments, or antidepressants can also cause interactions. If you use any of the following drugs, use them at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after you take levothyroxine: * calcium carbonate (Caltrate, Citracal, Oystercal, and others); * ferrous sulfate iron supplement; * sucralfate (Carafate); * sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate, Kionex, and others); * antacids that contain aluminum (Amphojel, Gaviscon, Maalox, Mylanta, Riopan, Rulox, Tums, and others); *cholesterol-lowering drugs cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid). Now for the facts on Norvac. . not gettig it you mean Norvasc by chance? I will run with that since the other is said not to exist and Norvasc is a BP medication: More common side effectsfor this medication is dizziness, fatigue, flushing, fluid retention and swelling, headache, palpitations (fluttery or throbbing heartbeat). This medication works as calcium channel blocking agents. These agents affect the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels.

I have been here on the boards telling people how bad I was feeling. I have been taking it for 21 days now - and the last two days have been better. A week ago - I would have given anything to have the doctor do something about how horrible I was feeling - but then over the weekend - I started feeling better. I think sometimes it does just take time. Call your doctor if your worried - I didn't have headaches - I had what I call \"restless body syndrome\" - like the restless leg syndrome you see on tv-except mine was throughout my whole body - so check with your doctor - but then - try to hang in there. I truly think it just takes time. I too want this all over - like - yesterday!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL "}, "1": {"a": "31031", "t": "Well - I have had Graves disease for over 10 years - went undiagnosed for 9 of them - but that is another long - long story. 2004-2005 was a super stressful year for me. Around summer of 2005 I noticed that my heart was racing all the time - even when in bed. Started losing weight despite eating more and more - hand tremors - voice tremors - horrible panic attacks - I waited until August to go to the doctor - he said he thought maybe I had an upper resp infection. Put me on antibiotics. Called him back in November and said something is wrong - and he got me in pretty quick. At this point I had looked up lots on the net and found that I had every symptom of hyperthyrodism. So he tested me and found out that I had not only hyperthyroidism - but Graves disease. Put me on Tapazole (40mg) and Enderal (120mg) a day and referred me to a endocrynologist. Went through three of those before I found one I liked. The Tapazole was knocking out my immune system and I got really sick. But they couldn't take me off it - because then my heart started to act up - so they suggested I have my thyroid removed. Which I did on March 29th -2007. I was in the hospital for two nights - because they couldn't get my calcium levels up. On April 3 - 5 days after my surgery I started to take 88mg of synthroid. That morning was the worst morning ever- I woke up and I couldn't move - I had this buzzing feeling moving from every part of my body - I posted on here and everyone thought it was my calcium out of whack - well - I called the doctor and he ordered Cortisol (vitamin d) and for me to take 2400mg of calcium. So since I started the synthroid and the calcium at the same time - I can only assume it is the synthroid in my body. That is exactly what it feels like - you see those commercials for restless leg syndrome - well mine is throughout my whole body. They have tested my calcium levels now and they are normal - so they only have me taking 1000mg a day with the cortisol and the last few days haven't been as bad as before. I don't know if it is something you just have to go through getting use to the synthroid - but I would kid my husband in the morning - \"here goes my electrically charging pill\". But then I looked it up on the net and Midwest1 told me that sometimes we have to allow 2-3 weeks or more for our bodies to get use to the medicine. Like I said though -the last 2-3 days have been way better. Bad news is - I see my endo on Thursday - and I know he is going to up my dosage of synthroid - because my last labs showed my tsh at 2.49 and he wants me near 1.0 - so I will probably have to go through more rough days. If I forget my calcium though- I noticed I do get more of that numbness - tingling feeling - so I make sure not to forget it anymore. Hope that helps. My surgeon told me that my parathyroid glands looked really good at surgery and she didn't have to mess with them much - but she also said that it can take some time for them to readjust after the trauma of having the thyroid removed. I don't know. Everyday is a guessing game for me right now. Wishing you well - let me know if I can help anymore. "}, "2": {"a": "31031", "t": "Well - I won't quit smoking then.

They are keeping close tabs on mine because well - I am a whiner - and I bother them so much - what do they say about the \"squeeky wheel\" - guess I am that. But I understand the frustration - it is a horrible feeling. Just don't start smoking again. I wish I could quit - you should be so proud of doing that and in the long run - it is the best for your health over all. See my doctor tomorrow - I am sure he will increase my synthroid - so I am sure I will be in for even more \"restless body syndrome\" for the weeks to come. But - maybe have them check your calcium and magnesium levels. It could be - like mine - they are still just stunned from the work you had done there.

He also is checking my calcium and magnesium levels. He said that there is always an underlying cause to this. That there could be more than just a thyroid problem with me. Perhaps my adrenal glands. He did not say what the other patients problems was - but at least he is checking into it. He said for me to start the new dosage tomorrow - from .88mg to 100mg now. I should call him right away if I start to get that same feeling again. My doctor seems really good - so I will keep you as informed as possible.

Sorry for the reason you're here but, glad you found us. I'm only able to interpret thyroid labs so, will comment on those The TPO test is one of the two tests for Hashi's antibodies. TPOab's are actually markers of thyroid inflammation so, your somewhat lower level probably isn't helping you get a diagnosis. You might want to try getting a TGab (thyroglobulin antibody) test since people with Hashi's usually test positive for at least one of the two antibodies. Your thyroid function tests indicate hypothyroidism, without a doubt. Your over-range TSH level is telling us that your pituitary glad is screaming at your thyroid to produce more hormone. As you can see, your actual thyroid hormone levels (FreeT4 and FreeT3) are near the bottom ends of their ranges. Healthy people have levels well above mid-range, if not closer to the high end of the range. Endos are the least likely to recognize hypothyroidism. DO's, internists or alternative MD's usually \"get thyroid\". I suggest you check the Top Thyroid Doctors site for listings of doctors in your state. Another idea is to get contact info from local pharmacists for doctors that Rx Armour - these doctors tend to be more thyroid-savvy.

You could try asking pharmacists (not the counter help) for the names of doctors that prescribe Armour - there's no legal reason why they can't provide this type of information so, if the first one you call isn't helpful, just move onto the next one.

But reading the methods for conducting the study you will see that all the study participants were treated based on their TSH levels alone, not on symptom relief or free T levels. So most of the studies show that patients start out doing pretty great but then fail to maintain their good state after a period of time. This is a great example of how studies can lead to misleading results because of not using good methods.

Botched up tests for mono which she had but the ER said it was negative. And on and on. It amazing any one is still alive in that area! With all of the above issues she was dealing with (within a years time of the original dx) it stands to reason daughter would benefit from a visit with the endo that originally dxd her condition (and performed the surgery).

That she felt confident in her ability to care for my dd, and with each new blood work up just change the dosage of the meds.

I never filled the script, though, because I'm very sensitive to side effects, and that medication is loaded with them. Many of the common ones listed are things that I'm actually trying like depression, mood swings, and anxiety.

I've hit a few bumps in the road, though, mainly because I ran out a couple of times because I didn't order it on time. I'll keep using it until it stops working, though. At that time, I guess I'll go back to the doctor and have her prescribe me a compounding cream. I just hope my insurance covers it.

According to a woman at another thyroid forum who's written about six books and sends out a monthly online newsletter, There's a lot of controversy among doctors right now about the normal TSH range, which could have been what was motivating your endo when you were doing fine(?) Someone in gov't may be causing it, because in approximately 2001 the gov't had all the meds \"standardized\", must not have even told doctors, and I developed a bad case of muscle pain, Fibromyalgia, still occasionally need some of my muscle relaxant which the Levothroid doctor prescribed without any idea of what was causing the pain. Besides arms, range of motion still limited, My heart muscle felt weak, every beat labored. Now they may be propagandizing that thyroid causes heart attacks, as some do for euthanasia and other kinds of changes. The \"standardizing\" must have been more severe for Levothroid because I'm almost optimized after switching to Levothyroxine 300. Or maybe it's the fillers or something. Several patients, at either this forum or another one which I don't think I'm allowed to mention here, increased their dosages and gradually obtained gradual relief, as did I, in just a couple of months.

I myself initiated quarterly blood tests to make sure I wasn't going too far overboard, which one bright doctor understood perfectly but didn't make an explanatory note of it in my chart. I read somewhere that the Dr. who invented the TSH test used about 19 (?) normal, not thyroid, people to arrive at his averages. Another doctor said the TSH tells how much hormone is circulating but not how much is being absorbed, and different labs may have different ranges, plus they keep changing the range. So, whatever you find out, will you keep us posted? I frankly don't think I'd let anyone do anything to my system that would eventually make me hypo if I wasn't already. Maybe the lab even made a mistake or he was misinformed (?) Especially if he resents you keeping up with things online, which happens to me a lot, I'd be concerned. One told me that doctors only study thyroid about 15 min and that literature I let him borrow may well be true but he just didn't know. He then shouldn't have ordered tests and cost me time and money! Another one who obviously doesn't know said thyroid's \"simple\" and you just give one or at most two grains of a synthetic, couldn't understand why I didn't stay there. It's very complicated. Some people also have overbearing relatives, who may have seen your bottle of pills while you're all young and were only take that one prescription (now I have diabetes and take several more) and think you're unfairly getting more attention than they are.

Empiric Radioactive Iodine Dosing Regimens Frequently Exceed Maximum Tolerated Activity Levels in Elderly Patients with Thyroid Cancer,? Journal of Nuclear Medicine Vol. 47 No. 10 1587-1591 ? The Evolving Role of 131I for the Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma? , Journal of Nuclear Medicine Vol. 46 No. 1 (Suppl) 28S-37S The 1940's was when the art of RAI was introduced and began its roll in thyroid carcinoma treatment. The studies on the role of RAI and its effects are quite extensive and start as far back as the 1950's. Several groups in the United States and Europe began to formally evaluate the safety and efficacy of RAI at this time. Early investigation showed that the best iodine uptake occurred when the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated. Not a mile stone assumption there. . the researchers determined that the best was to accomplish this effect and optimal RAI treatment was to withdraw patients from thyroid hormone and wait for the TSH to raise and balance out. What FUN! And they still do this to this day. 1) The most common and clinically documented side effects of 131I treatment are usually considered minimal and transient in the form of nausea and gastric pain. The typical duration is in the 2 weeks after treatment with a duration of a few days, but note typical is not an absolute. Some have it occur for longer and periodic periods. It all depends on your body and how well it will handle the RAI. 2) Sialadenitis (FANCY almost impossible to pronounce term that means swollen spit glands) is common in the first few days after therapy. This is associated with pain and enlargement of salivary glands (spit glands. . drool pits. . you get the piture. . expect a soar dry mouth ) but rarely progressing to chronic xerostomia (Another medical term that means permanent dry mouth due to diminished or dead salivary glands). The treatment most Mds recommend normally takes the form of drink lots of fluids (spit stimulating fluids ? lemon juice) and chew gum. There is no medical evidence that this is going to fix things. . but constant steady drinking should help with dry mouth. 3) The subsequent obstruction of salivary gland ducts may occur weeks to years later. In some cases patients experience periodic and sudden swelling, tenderness, and rarely infected salivary glands, most commonly the parotid gland. Ugh! This just sounds bad IMO. 4) Loss of taste (aka to Mds as dysgeusia) is a regular feature of post RAI treatment. Most commonly it only lasts a few days, but there are cases where the loss of taste is does not return completely. It would suck for chocolate to taste like dirty socks or something for the rest of your life. . I think it would give me serious depression to lose the taste of chocolate. 5) Ocular dryness (DRY EYES) and nasolacrimal drainage system obstruction (STUFFY NOSE AND BLOCKED SINUSES) have recently been reported in thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I . 6) In cases of large thyroid remnants neck edemas can manifest. Studies show edemas may be prevented by short-term corticosteroid therapy. 7) It is noteworthy that no respiratory sequelae (lung scar tissue) were observed after 131I treatments of diffuse lung metastases. The older you are the slower it is for you to purge that RAI. Patients over the age of 70 show the least tolerance to RAI exposure. These studies show that in older patients pulmonary complications do arise as a result of pooled or retained high RAI doses in lung metastases. 8) In males, repeated RAI administration is associated with an impairment of spermatogenesis (low sperm production = low sperm count = increased infertility), increased FSH levels, and decreased inhibin B levels. Testosterone levels seem to remain unchanged. 9) In females, RAI is shown to result in a transient ovarian failure, mainly in older pre-menopausal women, and an earlier onset of menopause. In addition there is an excess risk of breast cancer reported in females treated for a thyroid carcinoma by RAI. 10) The prevalence of these issues did not increase or change in cases of multiple exposure. One RAI is enough to increase your risk of the above issues. Now in females who desire to get pregnant, stidues have been extensive. There is no conclusive data showing that having an RAI before pregnancy effects the fetus AS LONG AS sufficient time is given to purge the RAI from your system. Issues arise when you conceive a child with in a year of having an RAI. Complications and issues with fetal development are maximized in females that did not wait a year post RAI to get pregnant. So it is well documented and recommended that females wait at least a year or longer after an RAI to attempt conception. It is also stressed that it can take a year or more post RAI until control of thyroid hormonal status has been achieved. So the Mds recommend that thyroid hormonal status should be carefully monitored (before conception and during pregnancy) post RAI to avoid hypothyroidism complications. 11) The results of many different studies of large groups of thyroid cancer survivors treated with RAI are also being monitored for an increased risk of solid tumors or leukemias. However given the study sets and parameter variations in the RAIs. . there is no definitive trend here and thus one must say it is inconclusive. 12) A large European study found an increased risk of all solid tumors in RAI thyroid cancer patients, and a site-by-site analysis found a relationship between RAI exposure and the occurrence of bone and soft tissue, colorectal, and salivary gland cancers. Studies are still on going to determine what sort of increased risk is caused by an RAI. 13) Since the introduction of RAI as a treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer in the early 1940s, repeated dosing is clearly documented to cause bone marrow depression. 14) Parathyroids have been known to take in RAI and die as a result of exposure as well.

Your dose should be tailored to you, but some MDs go by a set standard that may be too much or too little depending on you.

So if there is a heart of kidney issue radioactive iodine is going to hang in the system longer that normal.

All you Hashimoto's sufferers... as your thyroid is attacked and bombarded not only your thyroid, but the surrounding tissue and nerves are inflammed. In addition to this neat little ANNOYANCE you develop scar tissue internally. This scar tissue is just another side effect of your immune system trying to counteract our AI. The result of the scar tissue is that the biopsies and surgeries get harder and harder as more scarring occurs. It means you need a REALLY good surgeon to wade through the scar tissue to remove the bad stuff and leave the good stuff. So all in all I am depressed that I didn't get a definitive answer today.

He is such a dud. Sorry, but he is. Is this for Canadian made medication? The US has stringent FDA standards for US made prescription meds. There can be less than 5% variation in batchs. Generics due to filler effects will have the same 5% deviation in active ingredients, but the inactive ingredients do effect absorption. Absorption is 40-80% IF YOU EAT with your pill. If you take your meds first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and EAT NOTHING for an hour you will have 80-90% absorption of your thyroid meds through your digestive tract... baring a malabsorption disorder. From the FDA information archive on levothyroxine supplimentation,\"Absorption of orally administered T4 from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract ranges from 40% to 80%. The majority of the levothyroxine dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum.\" When you look at the bioavailability of Synthroid versus Levoxyl tablets in comparison to an equal nominal dose of oral levothyroxine sodium solution, Synthroid is 93% and is approximately 98% where. This is almost 100% which would indicate perfect absorption. Perfect absorption through the stomach and intestines has never happened in my research digging. T4 absorption is increased by fasting. The 93 and 98 percent absorption rates were fasting state absoprtion rates. Remember certian foods and suoplements can cause malabsorption of T4 as well. Soybean based protien diets are one of the worst at effecting T4 absorption. I wouldn't say your MD is a TSH WATCHER, but he is T3 blind.

I would definitely be feeling your lump and choking on it. The bigger it is the easier it is to get a good biopsy sample. . so you can look at it as being good for diagnosis methods... the bigger it is the easier to target and stick. Statistically, hypoechoic lesions have a higher risk of being malignant. Now this is just a differences of 10&#37;. So don't go leaping off the deep end. Hypoechoic malignancy is mainly papillary as well. . which is one of the easy to treat slow growing thyroid cancers. My lonely nodule is a perfect hypoechoic 8 mm diameter sphere. Little pest needs to grow some more. *grumble* Solid/cystic are inter changeable US terminology. In general it is believed that thyroid nodules with large cystic components are usually benign. This assumption is based on a belief that the nodules have undergone a cystic degeneration. There is a problem with this. .

So the picture with out the stick/biopsy and evaluation is incomplete in my opinion. Fancy term. . means irregular in shape. Not perfectly spherical. This does not really affect statistics much. Also Hashimoto's patients are known to have lobulated regions as a result of the sporadic thyroid tissue destruction. Did they expand on that at all or just state hypervascular? Color flow patterns... or how blood is taken into the thyroid and spit back out are normally lumped into three patterns of vascularity: (1) complete absence of flow signal within the nodule - dead. . cold. . no uptake of blood to the mass. (2) perinodular flow signals - nodule mass, but blood flow is normal throughout the tissue mass. (3) intranodular flow with multiple vascular poles chaotically arranged, with or without significant perinodular vessels... flow in and out of the mass with LOTS of vascular paths running all about. The (3) pattern is more commonly associated with a malignant growth, but (1 and 2) can also be malignant. Type three can be benign but there is a higher chance in comparison to (1 and 2) patterns that it can have a malignant character. Now the chances once again are slim. Less than 20%. So take comfort there. . I am just rattling off some facts for you to chew and process. I can not diagnosis you. echogenic is a fancy term used to describe a fluid pocket that can move or shift. The fluid or moving fluid-fluid levels normally correspond to hemorrhage, destroyed tissue pocket. Have you had a US guided FNA? Depending on what they were focused on with the MRI and CT scan, I am not surprised they missed the thyroid and any issues in it. Were they just looking at the brain and sinus areas with the MRI and CT. Most times they do target areas and not the whole body. I have had a couple of MRI's and many CTs. . mine focus in the head. Only requesting a US showed my nodule and throat inflammation. This should allow for additional visualization of the thyroid in relation to your head and neck. Given your information I would be pushing for a TT. But I want one. You have some factors that point to you being at higher risk for having a malignant nodule, BUT in other cases with increased factors like you and questionable FNA results. . only 26% of the TT biopsies on average come up malignant.

If you have TG post TT then you are at increased risk for new \"bad\" thyroid tissue growth. I do not know if there is a tumor marker test that you can run if you still have your thyroid. I will do a quick search. Thyroid Tumor marker lab codes: CEA and NSE Ranges CEA ng/ml... ref range (normal) <5... Moderate risk 5-10... High Risk >10 NSE ng/ml... ref range (normal) <15... Moderate risk 15-40... High Risk >40 There is a 15-30&#37; chance that you have a benign disorder causing a false positive on these tests. So once again the test is not 100%. But if they run these and you get a positive finding. . you have more ammo for a TT. Your labs may have a slightly different lab code, but this is what I got for my local ones. Hope it helps. MG "}, "19": {"a": "4333", "t": "Kassi, Good morning. I am sorry for your pains. That is a big difference in TSH. The hip and back pain make me think that you may be imbalanced and that you are hyperT in say your T4 levels while your T3 levels are low. The TSH is just a rough estimate of thyroid health. You really need to look at your Free T3 and T4 levels as well. I know I am beating a dead horse considering the NHS in the UK, but maybe MAZ or one of the others can give you a name of an MD that tests it all. Just treating the pain may not be treating the source of the issues. See if you can get at least a T4 and T3 run. While not as accurate as the Ft3 and Ft4 it will give a estimate of where you are in range. Watching TSH alone is insufficient. I am sorry that I don't have a quick fix for you. With the endocrine system quick fixes are a rarity. I am wishing you well and a pain free day. MG "}, "20": {"a": "4333", "t": "We did. The culture came back positive for it yesterday.

The first steps of diagnosing myasthenia gravis include a review of the individual's medical history, and physical and neurological examinations. The signs a physician must look for are impairment of eye movements or muscle weakness without any changes in the individual's ability to feel things. I had no ocular muscle impairment other than a slow focal adjustment. My antibodies are Hashimoto's all the way and they are attacking my milan brain nerve protien and optic nerve. Nasty. . but different than MG. When myasthenia gravis is suspected, several tests are available to confirm the diagnosis. There are key antibody blood tests that many MDs wait years to try. *snort* In particular the main identifier is a special blood test that can detect the presence of target immune molecules \"acetylcholine receptor antibodies\". Most people with MG have abnormally elevated levels of these antibodies. There is still that chance of a false negative... antibodies may not be detected in patients with only ocular (eye) forms of the disease. I did have target nerve receptor testing to rule out metacarple tunnel syndrome and a slew of other things. If my neurologist suspected MG they would have went alone that road. I fit the Hashimoto's encephalopathy hole too closely for them to look elsewhere. Hopefully your MD will draw the blood and keep moving on.

Sorry to hear of your struggles. The title of your thread confirms your suspicions - you are having conversion problems. Your very low FreeT3 level is most likely the cause of your issues. Based upon your lab's ranges for FreeT3, most people would need their level around 5.6. The antibodies don't interfere with the FreeT3 level per se. The antibodies are slowly destroying your thyroid. 20% of conversion happens in the thyroid so, a thyroid that isn't working properly won't be converting properly. Not much can be done about this without adding some T3 in the form or Cytomel or a switch over to Armour. "}, "1": {"a": "3258", "t": "Your new doctor should not wean you off Synthroid per se. The new doctor should Rx an equivalent dose of Armour - 1 grain. You will most likely need to have your dose tweaked a bit....and possibly add a small amount of Synthroid to keep your FreeT4/T3 levels balanced. The most important thing is to make sure your dose(s) are adjusted so both your FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels are maintained in the upper third of the range. Since the porcine thyroid in Armour has a larger proportion of T3 than T4 as compared to human thyroid, people wind up with proportionately higher FreeT3 than FreeT4 levels. Some people are OK with this - others need to add a small amount of Synthroid to balance things out. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can stop the antibody production. Yes, you can do things to reduce antibody titers but, everyone's response to antibody levels is different. Plus, whatever damage has been done cannot be reversed. For whatever it's worth, I take levothyroxine (generic Synthroid) and liothyronine (generic Cytomel) and am doing very well with this combination....I like the idea that I can adjust the T4 and 3 separately. I do see merit in natural thryoid as well....since I started off with levothyroxine and did well with it, it was easy enough for me to accept the T3 when my doctor offered it.

Now comes the grace part "}, "3": {"a": "3258", "t": "Thanks for your kind words. If our thyroid hormone levels haven't been optimized for us, we'll have various issues - the severity of which are often determined by how \"off\" our levels are for our individual needs. There's not much we can do to stop our disease course....the best we can do is to make sure our thyroid hormone levels have been optimized for our own particular needs. Otherwise, the body struggles to restore homeostasis....and, this can increase antibody production. I know that, when I was horribly over-medicated on anti-thyroid drugs (thanks to clueless endo #2), I had elevated cholesterol and blood glucose levels for the first time in my life. Thankfully, all resolved and stay resolved since I learned what I needed to know to feel well while having thyroid disease. While you may not be happy with the improvement you've had thus far, you could very well have improvement that isn't just measured by numbers. (and, really, you've tripled your HDL - kudos to you!) Unfortunately, even with a reduction in antibody titers, it doesn't seem like that will reduce our need for thyroid hormone replacement...the damage is done and, truly, everyone has a different response to antibodies. I've been taking selenium for a very long time (I'm sure you know it's been shown to reduce TPOab's). Well, I wasn't even testing positive for TPOab's when I first started taking it....now, I am. Maybe my level would be higher - who knows? We do the best we can with what we have. I think a healthy lifestyle (good diet, regular exercise, healthy mindset) bodes well for everyone and, most especially, for those of us dealing with health issues. I suspect that you will see an improvement in your cholesterol and blood glucose levels once your thyroid hormone levels have been optimized. I have always exercised - just don't feel right if I don't. It was very difficult for me last summer as I was titrating up on my levo dose - I just couldn't maintain my regular level of intensity. Now, that my thyroid hormone levels have been optimized and I've been able to maintain those levels, I'm actually seeking new exercise challenges...this makes me very happy I think you're on the right track....it's \"just\" a matter of time before you'll reap the benefits of all your hard work.

Well I went stepwise through treatment and diagnosis. 1) First found and treated was the Hashimoto's/hypothyroidism as a result of my symptoms and extremely high antibodies. This started me on T4 supplementation (Brand names: Levoxyl, Synthroid, Levothyroxine, and Tirosint... there are more and there are probably brands specific ones in your country as well). I was started on 50 mcg of Synthroid. This helped with some symptoms but not all. Pushing the thyroid medication was warranted by my Ft4 level, but over conversion of T4 to T3 drove me hyperthyroid by T3 toxicosis. Symptoms fixed: Thyroid eye disease, migraines, some fatigue, constipation 2) This pointed that I had another issue to address. . hypoadrenalism. So we did the tests: Saliva 24 hour cortisol, ACTH, ACTH stimulation test, DHEA, Cortisol fasting 8 am blood serum, estrogen, testosterone, vit D, B12, ferritin. My ferritin B12, K, and D were all low. This and the cortisol levels being in the out house pointed to hypoadrenalism. I then had testing for the antibodies that kill off the adrenals (ACA) and found out my adrenals just died from too long hypoT. But my TSH was normal! *snort* So I was put on 20 mg of hydrocortisone daily in addition to 75 mcgs of Synthroid. Things were beginning to feel better, but things were still not right. I researched the ACTH stim sex hormone results and cross matched my symptoms and the HIGH DHEA levels and went back to my MD with my MD SIL's list of tests need to confirm/refute PCOS and IR. . Symptoms addressed: electrolyte imbalance, heart issues, fatigue, hypersomnia 3) So I was tested for PCOS/IR/hypoglycemia. This was proven by my blood results and uterine ultrasound. I had all three. . WHEEE! I love the pre-existing conditions line on medical information forms. The receptionist look at you funny when you ask for another sheet because you ran out of room... Treatment Metformin XR. I stepwise progressed to 1500 mg. Symptoms addressed: weight gain in the middle, PMS/PMDD symptoms, irregular periods, mood swings, and many other pesky female things. A large portion of remaining fatigue went away as well as energy was increased upon treatment. Now my thyroid hormone levels while suboptimal and low for me are balanced. My blood sugar/insulin issues are balancing out with the Metformin XR. My hypoadrenalism is in check. So symptoms left are the skin issues which I keep in check with my Dermie's help and special creams, weight is stagnant, joint and muscle issues, cold feeling, and periodic fatigue. I am working on getting rid of them all, but it does take time. Now it is a matter of getting my thyroid hormones optimal and seeing where things go from there.

I requested these drugs because of all of the great stuff I read about it on this healthboard years ago, and on the thyroid-info site. I wish that in those places it had been mentioned that these drugs might cause problems to those who can convert T4 to T3 and to have your doctor test you to see if you can convert T4 to T3 before getting on those. If I had read that you can be sure I would have asked my doctors to do this. Sometimes when I did feel bad after getting off of cytomel, I was suspicious that my body had become depended on the T3 and had stopped converting so well the T4, but by then I KNEW to ask to test if I was converting. But that was after my nightmare with T3. I am, by the way, converting fine, and if I do have a problem in the future, believe me, I will try to do something about it. But, it doesn't seem I will, as those in my family tree who are taking thyroid meds, all are doing well on just levothyroxine for years and years, so this might not be a problem for my gene line, thank God. Thanks for sharing your experience on Levoxyl. That was weird! All the times on my meds I was worried about losing my hair, but I never got that problem, only the ones that couldn't be seen, like strange sensations.

allready knows and he shouldnt get mad because i went there because he knew i told him i wasnt feeling good he thought it was all in my head first he thought i was bipolar ,i think he just down right thought i was crazy told my hubby i look on the computer about the thyrold too much so i think im worse then iam i said no i do research and theres nothing wrong in doing that its my body and i have to live with this illness for life so i try to find out everything i possibly can about the illness . hugs to all of you wonderfull people and yes im still praying for everyone of you who have to suffer with this illness like me its horrible when my sister had it i never knew much about it i had no idea that it made you feel so horrible but it does .......................BIG BIG HUG TO ALL OF YOU. vickie "}, "5": {"a": "10201", "t": "hey loretta great to hear from you and yes iam very very happy i finally found a good dr who listens to me and not just my labs shes very good and she knew when i told her my symtons and from the labs said i was no where near my normal range and that other dr told me to have my next tsh in 6 mos some drs are just so dumb ,and guess what i havent fell asleep so far tonight and i went back to bed this morning for a couple hrs because i wake early again but that too will pass im allready feeling better on this new medication all my symtons have gone no more pain in my arms or dizziness or diarea i still have some panic still but the endo said that sometimes people get panic with thyrold and that sometimes it goes away and sometimes it dont she said some people live with it all there lives and i did have the panic long before i got the thyrold and i do have the xanax so that does help ,but i only take as i need them . and yes we both will celebrate when we finally feel good again . along with all the others who suffer this horrible illness ,i just hope this never happens again but i kept telling that dr i wasnt feeling good and he said well you been within normal range for mos if thats so then why was he having me keep coming back into his office so much its called MONEY ,i went a week without my meds cause i couldnt take the chest pains and the endo even said he should have known that was a side effect along with being over medicated even the drugstore told me that but he wouldnt change my meds nor lower them so i went to a endo and im so glad i have alot of faith in this woman and i know shes going to help me feel good again and thats what she told me too said she will get me back to feeling great again she may be young but she knows her stuff too i felt so happy when we left her office and sorry if my old dr is mad but its my body and he wasnt helping me none i will go to him for my b/p meds and my xanax and any other medical prob i may have . and hubbys job is gettig new insurance bluecross/blue shield hope its better then what we have now.how have you been loretta i saw in one of your posts where you wasnt feeling too well i will PRAY AND PRAY AND PRAY for anyone who has this ugly illness its horrible and sometimes it seems like forever before we feel good again.but like you said we will look back on this and say how did we ever make it through this tough time we went through but i have alot of faith in god and yes we all will get better some get better sooner then others and some take longer but in the end we will be ourselfs again . how do you like the 1mg xanax? it helps me alot hope they help you as well. hugs i will be on tomorrow im allready feeling better and i only started the new meds today. vickie "}, "6": {"a": "10201", "t": "Jenni, no she said she knew i was overmedicated just by looking at my labs i took all my labs with me from the start jan to the last one and by my symtons she said she could tell right then i was way over medicated and said i was no where near within my range plus she said everyone is different and said our bodies feel good at different ranges like one person may feel good at a 1 and another may feel good at a 2 or higher and some may feel good below the 1 each one of us has differet bodies the ranges say normal but even when i was at 1.5 which said i was within normal range it wasnt right for my body cause i wasnt feeling good at 1.5 plus other things that was causeing it was the levo/synthrold wasnt right for me why it waited 6 mos to do it i dont know ,for one the drs kept trying to up me way too fast this new endo is going to take me slow and thats the way they should do it till they find the right dose for me plus the right meds this is day 2 and guess what i was able to fall back to sleep this morning after i took my pill and im allready starting to feel better on this medication i dont feel as tired and i hope it keeps up i know it takes time im like starting all over again but i dont have the symtons i had with the levo/synthrold my arms no longer hurt im not getting headaches as much nor the dizziness and im not falling asleep in evening as much i did the first day and i feel like cleaning my house today i told hubby please be patient with me i will get better it just takes time and he said he will try to understand but if he could have my illness just once then he'd know what i felt the endo also told me that my deep depression and moodswings and the crying spells i had was from being hypo and when i took the other meds i was on i would feel real sweaty then cold now i dont feel that so im glad i didnt end up taking a anti depressent i hate them for one i tried so many and none ever helped me im not crabby either i was on the other meds but at times im crabby but who isnt . and i dont need to go to no mental ward either my other dr wants me to see a psychiatrist but i dont need too he must be a dr who just guesses at what he thinks is wrong if and when i do finally go into menopause and i feel i need something for my hormones then i will talk with my gyn but so far i feel fine my breasts hurt only once in awhile but thats about it i see gyn july 30th for my pap and mam.im 45 and i dont feel like iam i still cant go to the stores just yet and i have to be in a wheel chair at the drs till my falling down stops if that goes away i could deal with the aneity now the panic i hate it scares me makes me cry and then i fall.but im going to church tomorrow the first time in yrs but like i said i have alot of faith in god and he will be at my side helping me along i truly believe hes the one who sent me to that endo . i wikll be back to the boards later on if my kids dont beat me to the

treating me for panic and depression and had me on ugly effexor xr 75 mg and thats the worst anti d ever i wont ever take any more anti d's ever again for one they never helped plus trying to come off them are horrible . but i will keep you all posted so far im feeling pretty good other then the falling asleep but i dont fall asleep as much as before and i dont feel exhausted either now thats pretty good if you ask me so far i love this med levo didnt even do this for me i couldnt take it after 6 mos but if i wasnt over medicated i prob could have but it just didnt work for me hugs vickie

did the right thing i dont think they'd be mad i did the same thing with my old dr when he wasnt checking my t4 i put a x by it too and they didnt even relize it so shes doing TSH,FT3&4, ANTI TPO,CORTISOL,is that spelled right is that the one your talking about? so i did it myself so be it im paying for it . she prob wont even know what tests she had run and if she does i will just say the lab ran it for me . im feeling better this is day 3 i still get sleepy and tired some but thats normal . i will get better you wait and see and yes i need to up my dose slowly not fast like before because when they did it threw me into hyper symtons ,but so far im feeling better i dont have the arm pains or stomach but i take a protonix or prevacid for that only one though not both at same time amd im a little dizzy but i also had that at the beginning too but the dr i saw back then the gp kept telling me it was severe panic well i think its the thyrold causeing it cause when i was at 1.5 i wasnt dizzy only a little so all this will go away it takes time my sister whos had hypo for 12 yrs said it took her a whole yr before she started feeling good its only been 6 mos so far for me since i found out i even had it but i did suffer a whole yr before that which was that drs fault and thats why im in the process of sueing him ...............let me know about those test i just posted and

symptoms seem to be worse during allergy season. There has also been questions wondering if maybe allergies could contribute to thyroid antibodies count going up. I had no answer to those questions but it did get me wondering. That's why I'm posting this new thread. Is there evidence that allergies could make the thyroid antibodies go up? I've posed this next question to a couple of doctors. Is there any studies indicating a link between thyroid antibodies (or any antibodies) and asthma? No one had an answer. I've been diagnosed (if you want to call it that) with \"possible\" asthma. Lately, I have been feeling much like I did when I was first dx'd hypo. I suspect I have an allergy to some sort of plant or flower but I've not been tested for that.

Lately, he is starting to show a few signs of possible hyperthyroidism. He hasn't been tested yet but will be soon. My coughing for no apparent reason started probably about a year and a half before I was diagnosed hypo. I'd say that's about six months after the first signs of my hypo began. As far as allergies go, I haven't been tested yet. I know I'm allergic to some kind of plant or flower because my eyes start tearing and I get post nasal drip every time I go to the garden center at Home Depot and sometimes when I'm walking around the neighborhood.

In May, it went back down to the lowest point since beginning meds (4.8). I was taking the same dosage in April (125mcgs Levothyroxine) as in May and my TSH went down 28 points. I KNOW I have Hashi's. I don't need an antibodies test to tell me that. Autoimmune diseases run rampant in my family.

I won't try to understand your situation, and your decision not to have surgery at this time. Athough for me, the way I've been feeling the past few months, I'm actually happy there might be a solution. However if there wern't on option for Mini-Surgery, the decision would be much more difficult to make. My only question is now, is that the only problem. As I said, I've been losing weight, pretty much all year, but more so the last couple months. Though I have been exercising more, I can't seem to gain any weight, even though I'm eating pretty good.

They will just run every test known to man to rule everything out, which is ok. BUT after they rule everything out, they will say, \"We don't know why your calcium is high, let's just watch it for a while\". Meanwhile the tumor in your neck is growing.

MG "}, "17": {"a": "4333", "t": "This one is for you and all you fighting T3 taking ladies and gents out there! (SHMILY) Let's talk mechanistically, what makes the pituitary gland produce TSH? Well there is a cycle and it is one of the most complex in our body. Your hypothalamus tell talks to the pituitary gland which talks to the thyroid which provides feed back to the hypothalamus. Think of a series of buckets (visual imagery is thanks to Antiendo) on above the other. The hypothalamus bucket is above the pituitary bucket which is above the thyroid bucket and the liver is the bicycle messenger. The hypothalamus receives a message stating that free T3 levels are not enough. . so the bucket tips pouring TRH into the pituitary bucket. The pituitary bucket then uses the TRH to produce TSH which it tips and pours into the thyroid bucket. The thyroid takes the TSH and proceeds to make the requisitioned amount of T4 (if all is working optimally) releasing it into the blood stream for the tissue and liver to process into the necessary T4, T3, and T2 quantities. The liver notes levels and begins the communication cycle all over again. This is once again the workings of a perfectly functioning system. So any interference in this loop can cause abnormal thyroid function. This system is referred to as the hypothalamic?pituitary?thyroid (HPT) feedback system. To study this interaction ? patients were submaximally suppressed for one month with a fixed daily dose of T3? . [2] This has been known since the NIH accepted studies on the matter back in 1976!!! [3] Findings in this study are, ? Group data also suggested that TSH suppression was significantly correlated to basal TSH. This means that a NTG patient with a low normal TSH in blood before suppression (basal TSH) and a high degree of autonomous function may exhibit a relatively high TSH suppression. This ensures a minimal stimulation of the thyroid gland thereby protecting the gland from developing hyperthyroidism. A patient with a high normal TSH in blood before suppression (basal TSH) and a low degree of autonomous function, may exhibit a relatively low TSH suppression, indicating a high stimulation of the thyroid gland thereby protecting the patient from developing hypothyroidism. ? [2] Basically this is saying T3 is going to suppress your thyroid and in patients that still have thyroid function and start out with a TSH of 2 per say will suppress quicker and more dramatically than someone with a TSH of 10 before starting T3 supplementation. There is no doubt what so ever that T3 will not suppress thyroid function via TSH. The thyroid is shut down when T3 is entered into the system and the liver has no call to produce more. Break. . see next post. Sorry this is a long one. "}, "18": {"a": "4333", "t": "Part 2 with the reference list. Now how exactly does l-T3 supplementation fit in and cause the HPT system to shut down. Thyroid hormones exert direct effects on the hypothalamic function that modulate TSH secretion. [4] Overt hypothyroidism occurs when TRH mRNA levels in the PVN are increased. Supplementation of T4 and T3 reduce the TRH mRNA levels reducing the hypothalamic call to the pituitary gland to produce more TSH. L-T4 supplementation is an indirect TRH suppressor. The T3 generated from the supplemented T4 suppresses the TRH and thus the TSH. In the case of direct supplementation of L-T3 the suppression is four fold that of L-T4 supplementation. In addition to higher suppression of TRH, L-T3 stimulates the low production of SRIH in hypothyroid patients. [4] These combined effects of TRH suppression and SRIH stimulation drastically decrease TSH secretion by the pituitary gland. [3,4] So if you take T3 supplementation you will have to optimize using actual T4 and T3 levels and symptoms, because the hypothalamic-pituitary stimulation loop shuts down. Another known group of mild TSH suppressors are glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids interfere with the TSH response to TRH and suppress/abolish the nocturmal TSH surge in humans. [4] 30 ? 50 mg of hydrocortisone will suppress the TSH 60-70&#37;. [4] Adrenal insufficient patients (Low TSH, Low T4, High T3) take approximately 20 mg of HC spread through out the morning and afternoon. Cushing's patients sufferer extensively from TSH suppression. (Low TSH, High T4, Low T3). Now you do not have to be out of normal range to suffer from the adrenal issues. You just need to be out of balance. If you suffer from a deviation of 20% or more in your Ft3 and FT4 levels there may be an adrenal issue aggravating your issues and thyroid hormone balance. Finally. . this is a kicker for all you nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) consumers (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, etc). . studies are indicating that with in 2-4 hours of taking NSAIs the TSH is suppressed as a result of the mechanistic inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In high dose NSAI patients can be suppressed below the normal range in TSH! How? Well it is still supposition, but the leading theory is that NSAIs decrease TSH indirectly by displacement of thyroid hormones from key protien binding sites increasing the levels of free thyroid hormone and causing feedback suppression of TSH through TRH reduction. Whew! That was a lot of research and now has some people scratching their heads or in information overload. To summarize TSH suppression facts: Fact 1: T4 suppresses TSH by allowing your liver to increase active levels of T3. Higher levels of T3 in the blood drop the TRH call of the hypothalamus to the pituitary thereby lowering the TSH. Fact 2: Direct addition of T3 has a 4 fold increase in TRH suppression in addition it stimulates SRIH production which further inhibits TSH production independent of actual T4 and T3 blood levels. Fact 3: Glucocorticoids interfere with the TSH response to TRH and suppress/abolish the nocturmal TSH surge in humans. Fact 4: Nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs such as (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, etc) interfere with thyroid hormone binding to proteins leaving you hypothyroid in process ability while suppresses the TSH due to the additional free T4 and T3 in your system. Any questions? So if an MD cuts your dosage due to your TSH not your FT3 and Ft4 levels and you are subject to any of the TSH suppressors above. Read him the facts and educate him/her.

This is for the special hyperTs or hypoT/hyperT combos out there! You asked for it! TPOAb automimmune function will be coming up next. Working on it. Basic definition and meaning: TSI = thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin. TSI is the antibody responsible for hyperthyroidism in Graves? disease. TSI are also known as stimulating TSH receptor antibodies or stimulating thyrotropin receptor antibodies. Function: TSIs actually interfere with and stimulate the TSH receptor on thyroid cells. The TSIs are the great pretenders, they mock and act in place of TSH to call the thyroid to activate. So think of havinf a TSH of 0.8, well having TSI in addition may actually make your body see that point 0.8 as 3 or more and your thyroid enters an over production phase. TSIs in a fully functional thyroid stimulate thyroid cells to produce excess thyroid hormone. In a Hashi's thyroid, they do the same;but every time the thyroid is overstimulated TPOAbs are produced and the thyroid is hammered. Even with the call for overstimulation overtime the Hashimoto's ABs will kill off the thyroid and destroy it. TSIs in conjunction with Hashimotos guarantee a rougher ride and wider fluctuations. General facts: TSI also contribute to the related thyroid eye disease, also known as Graves? ophthalmopathy. TSI is the dominant antibody used to diagnose Graves? disease. It is also used to monitor response the anti-thyroid drugs and to help predict remission. I personally question using a number alone to predict remission, but you know Endos and their numbers. So let's talk numbers! 1) While the normal range is <110 - 130% activity depending on your labs range (some labs divide by 100 to show numbers 1.1 - 1.3), it is documented fact that individuals who are normal do not produce TSI and have levels <2% in activity. 2) The 2% or less basically equals the standard deviation of the test and is considered a reading of 0. 3) Individuals with levels between 2 and 125 % indicates they have Graves thyroid autoimmunity present. 4) Between the levels of 2 and 125% individuals statistcs show patients overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism until levels rise above 125%. Once again the double speak covers the not possible belief, in case you prove them wrong. But they use the magic levels \"much lower than 125%\" are necessary to predict complete remission. Well we all know how normal one is and that numbers should be fudged and symptoms taken into account. 5) In addition the recommended level of remission is close to 100% activity. At this point they believe anti-thyroid drugs should be weened off. ??? Humm?? Well my Aunt N has stubborn antibodies. She is hanging tough and eats like a cow with the figure of a crane. *sigh. . wishful thoughts of shrinking hypot tummy* Back to point... It is documented that TSI levels generally rise when patients stop taking anti-thyroid drugs. So quarterly and symptom induced TSI testing is recommended to catch any reoccurance of Graves. Additionally statistical studies show an ideal remission is when patients levels fall to at least 20%. So it is documented that Graves patients can suffer with symptoms in the 20 - 110% of normal range. 6) The reference range is <110 - 130% activity or an index of <1.1 - 1.3 for tests that measure the increased activity caused by adding patient serum to a test solution of thyroid cells. Well HEY! I have Graves too! Frick and Frack! My TSI were 110%! Back in July before the symptom slurry hit horrid levels! ARGH! *thinking dirty words in four languages* Okay. . I literally just had a bulb go off, I didn't question the TSI anymore after I left my Endo in September. The logic of the Hashimoto's will win in the end. You have Hashimoto's stuck in my naive self.

Here are some facts I have dug up that might help with general thyroid care and Hashimoto's cases as well. In answer to WHY should I bother to run FTs on you. TTs are better. Well I will grant them that TTs have been around a LONG time. They came about in the 1950s. So people should be well practice in running the test. The last update to analytical technique and method was in the 1970s. Now here is a listing of the facts: For patients with MDs that believe T.T.s are better than FTs: Analytical methods according to N A C B analysis methods: 1) Current Total Ts are run using RIA methods developed in the 1970s. 2) Currently TT4 and TT3 concentrations are primarily measured by competitive immunoassay techniques that use radioactivity, enzymes, fluorescence or chemiluminescent molecules as signals. 3) Total hormone methods are an indirect method of measuring actual T4 and T3 levels. The totals require the inclusion of inhibitors, such as 8-anilino-1-napthalene-sulphonic acid, to block hormone binding to serum proteins in order to facilitate hormone binding and analysis. Stick with me. . 4) Serum TT3 method and development is similar to that of TT4, however the fact that TT3 concentration is ten-fold lower presents a sensitivity and precision issue in analysis. 5) So all the technical double speak leads to the following: The inter-method variability or standard deviation for total hormone measurements (TT4 and TT3) is... drum role. . (10-17&#37; and 20-30%, TT4 and TT3, respectively). SO go for the FTs that have a variation and accuracy of 2.5-5%! The main issue that is against them is that they are not cost effective to be run routinely. WELL, I think we should be the ones to determine how much we are willing to spend in our health care, no? Just my take on the issue. MG "}, "22": {"a": "4333", "t": "This one is for those with high antibody levels. . high Hashimoto's antibody levels. I found an article in support of the advice people have been spreading with regards to Selenium. Roland G&#228;rtner, Barbara C. H. Gasnier, Johannes W. Dietrich, Bjarne Krebs and Matthias W. A. Angstwurm ? Selenium Supplementation in Patients with Autoimmune Thyroiditis Decreases Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies Concentrations? The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism Vol. 87, No. 4 1687-1691 The recommended dosage was the 100&#37; daily limit, but selenium can be toxic if you take too much. Hence I recommend seeing if you are deficient or not. Also make sure you look through your current supplements and make sure that you are not already taking the maximum daily amount. MG "}, "23": {"a": "4333", "t": "The Hashimoto's antibodies, and my take on TPOAb = Thyroid Peroxidase Autoantibodies TGAb = Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies Approximately 70-80 % of patients with Graves' disease and virtually all patients with Hashimoto's, atrophic thyroiditis or post-partum thyroiditis have TPOAb detected. [5,6,7,8,9] This floored me, especially the POST-PARTUM thyroiditis patients! How many women after pregnancy can be diagnosed and treated early to save their future children and themselves from unknown suffering. ARGHHH! In fact, TPOAb is implicated as a cytotoxic agent (active thyroid tissue mauler and destroyer) in the thyroiditic process. [10,11] TPO antibodies are a major factor involved in the tissue destructive processes in Hashimoto?s thyroiditis hypothyroidism. Recent NHANES survey of approximately 17,000 subjects without apparent thyroid disease were tested for TPOAb presence. Out of that study TPOAb was detected in 12.6 % of subjects! That is 2142 out of 17000! [12] So TPOAb's actually attack and rip apart thyroid tissue. Simple and complete. Your Immune system makes them and your thyroid gets the beat down. No fancy disguise and mimicry. . just flat out seek and destroy of thyroid tissue. As the tissue dies the ability for the thyroid to meet your needs decreases. Until function is neigh non-existant or gone. Changes in autoantibody concentrations often reflect a change in disease activity, serial thyroid autoantibody. This doesn't correlate to how much thyroid hormone you need so you can not monitor it as a form of treatment, but you can use it to see how aggressive your AITD is. . Someone with >1000 antibodies has a more aggressive case than someone with 60. . etc. The presence of TPOAb has now been established as a risk factor for developing thyroid dysfunction in the future depending on drug therapies and genetic predisposition,[13-16] so why aren't they testing it. . bet it comes down to MONEY! The other reason not to test that I have heard is. . well hypoT and hashimoto's have the same treatment. . so testing isn't necessary. TPOAbs are more common in Diabetes, B12 deficiency, and increased prevalence of subclinical (mild) and clinical hypothyroidism. So testing people that have these conditions may allow for prophylactic treatment of Hashimoto's and stave off the nasty hypoT issues. There has already been a 20 year study on patients with TPOAbs. [17,18] From this and others it is known that a detectable TPOAb is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and typically precedes the development of an elevated TSH . [18,19] Also the presence of TPOAb has been linked to reproductive complications such as miscarriage, infertility, IVF failure, fetal death, pre-eclampisa, pre-term delivery and post-partum thyroiditis and depression. [20-25,26-31] As too money? Well it is generally considered cost-effective to replace semi-quantitative AMA agglutination tests by TPOAb immunoassay methods because you do not have to do the TGAb test unless you want a second supporting identifier of Hashimoto's. And just one test in women planning pregnancy can help reduce a lot of nasty complications. I would have elected to pay for it early in my pregnancy. Addison's disease, diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism, hypoparathyroidism, and pernicious anemia. When you have more than one of these in combination with Hashimoto's/hypoT you fall under the classification of polyglandular failure syndrome. Anyone have more than one of those and not told this? *snort* Two forms of polyglandular autoimmunity are recognized in the medical community... that is aware of them [32]. Type I syndrome: hypoparathyroidism, muco-cutaneous candidiasis, Addison's disease, and occasionally overt hypothyroidism. Type II syndrome (most common and includes familial associations. . bad genes attack again!!) : diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, and occasionally gonadal or pituitary failure. (OH. . OH. . I have secondary hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism (aka adrenal insufficiency, Hashimoto's, and beaten down Graves! Lucky me!)

Why not share and share alike amongst your endocrine system. Other known Hashimoto's bonuses: Vitiligo, hives, and alopecia! Others things to look into and look out for are primary and secondary Sjogren's syndrome[33], and progression with time to the picture of Riedel's thyroiditis including the frequently-associated retroperitoneal fibrosis[34]. I am not saying this is a guarantee evolution, but if you treat the Hashi's and stuff still doesn't to the line a mutation such as this may have occurred. You are just looking at a 10 chance. . but that is 1 out of 10 of us. So knowledge equals early diagnosis and better care in the slim chance it occurs. Ugh! That looks bad.

Blood sugar in the 80's and 100's is pretty normal. When there is a problem though is when it is 80 and then drops down into the 50's within a short amount of time, or if its 100 and drops into the 70's or 80's within a short amount of time. This can cause dizziness, fainting, irritability etc. The only way to know if your blood sugar is doing this is to get a tester and check it an hour after you eat and then an hour after that or check it when you have the symptoms to see where your sugar is at.

The 62 for you blood sugar is a bit low, especially if it was higher and dropped to that in a short amount of time. You sound like you are having sympoms of low blood sugar. Dizziness and fainting are symptoms as well as irritability, anxiety, shakiness, shortness of breath, muscle twitches, and the list goes on. Try eating small amounts every 2 hours. Stay away from sugar as much as possible and eat whole grains, protiens and vegetables. Also when you have fainting spells or maybe shakiness take vitamin C right away. At least about 1000mg. This will help to keep from fatiguing your adrenals because when your blood sugar drops your adrenals kick in to keep you going and that can fatigue them. A lot of people have blood sugar problems when their thyroid is out of whack. If you can get your thyroid leveled off then your blood sugar should do better as well. I was hypoglycemic for many years (runs in my family) before being diagnosed with Hashi's and right before being diagnosed my blood sugar was so terribly low all the time. I was having to eat hourly to keep it up. But since being on thyroid meds it has leveled off and I can go 2 to 3 hours now. Hopefully the new dr will get you where you need to be with your thyroid.

T4 has a TWO WEEK half life, meaning what you take this morning isn't actually 'seen' cellularly for about eight DAYS (see how people go hyPER by upping meds without leaving weeks in between to see labs??) . But...T3 has a half life of four HOURS.

Because the active hormone is the T3, and since I've taken the SAME dosage for over six weeks, he uses a formulary that tells him what my 'real time' levels are by doing FT's. So, it looks like doing labs about four to six hours after taking meds would give you and the doc a look at just how the levels are doing on a daily basis.

She told me that my neck is rippled when I was newly born. I never know the condition of my thyroid at that time, and I developped an enlarged thyroid at a very early age, with a \"normal\" TSH. That eased me a little, but who knows if the antibodies were not passed onto me then? I have another question, and the antibodies really transfered to it. What should doctors do? If nothing can help, would the newly born infant have a very HIGH TSH (100+)? Sorry to hear about your son's immune infection, but thankfully you have given him the best medical care....---Did you have him tested for Total Igs? Or specific Igs? I gonna have Igs tested, but don't know much about that...My neutrophilicgranulocyte and lymphocyte's % is abnormally low and high in the CBC tests, which I suspect that is due to the chronic infection, but don't know what the virus/bacteria is... BTW, my cousin also develop AI disease, ankylosing sporidylitis. Although it is not a disease whose gene is related to Hashimoto's directly, that prompts me to have HLA-B27 antibody tested... BTW again, I think the current medical care extends our life somehow also give us the privilege to give birth to child, I can't imagine what is hypos' life like before 1900's.

"}, "3": {"a": "4333", "t": "Okay, Good questions all. In the case of did antibodies transfer you can not know if you were not tested shortly after birth and yearly after that. My son was not tested for antibodies until he was 4. He had none, so if I transferred any to him they were gone by then. With nugget2 I will have the baby tested at birth and know. I will also be able to follow the levels or lack of levels at yearly examinations. My son does not have an immune infection, but a deficiency. He has had a COMPLETE immune panel run. Targeted and total Ig's. We get them tested yearly. In some the immune system rebounds at the age of 8. We hope that will be the case. If not sinus infections are treatable. In the case thyroid issues are detected the fight is done through you. The child will only be born with a TSH of 100+ if you are not getting enough T4 to pass on to the child. You must have enough T4 in your system for you and the child through out the pregnancy. This suppresses the antibody activity and makes sure that any developing nodules oe inflammation in the child is minimized. It falls back on proactively treating Hashimoto's. . but it is done through you. If the child can not make enough T4 on its own it will continue to take yours even after the first 22 weeks when it is dependent on your T4. The complications arise when you the mother does not have enought thyroid hormone to support yourself and the child because the MDs treating you do not follow your levels closely of get hung up on the TSH. If you keep the FT4 levels at least above 30% while pregnant... the child will be taking what it needs. . you will suffer the hypoT back lash though. I can testify to that because I am at 34% of normal range and just got another 12.5mcg boost to 150 mcgs. My MDs are bumping me every 2-3 weeks til I hit 50-60%. My fetus is developing normally and not showing any signs of deprivation. It is just greedy and taking what it will. Maybe it is a boy after all.

I think it was my Saturday that I missed. On my Saturday, I went outside to enjoy the sunshine. It was nicely warm and I couldn't resist. My Sunday it snowed. I do believe you are about a day ahead of me and sometimes it takes awhile for me to catch up to you. With my hyperthyroid, I might just catch up pretty soon Yes, my husband was there during the war. He was a marine for 20 years. He has many regrets for that time in history. He's happy to know that I am communicating with someone from over there. He too is curious as to how everything turned out. It would be so nice if this dermatologist can help you and please let us know what your thyroid tests show when you get them. On the eyes, it is my understanding that hypothyroid can cause swollen eyes. It is mainly from retention of water I do believe. Grave's ophthalmopathy is probably something you do not have to worry about. Grave's disease causes hyperthyroidism. If you are hypo, you do not have grave's disease. The one thing you will find when you are new to thyroid disease is that everything you read, you will believe you have. Thyroids are incredible creatures and can cause many, many symptoms. The thyroid controls every organ in the body to some extent and can do some pretty strange things when it is not working properly. The best thing to do is to learn as much as you can about how the thyroid actually works. Then you do not have to be so worried every time something strange happens. And you're right, negative thoughts will not get you anywhere. I will see if I can find some information on the Saw Palmetto. It's always good to look for something to explain certain symptoms when you are not sure if it is thyroid related or not. I will get back to you on that. Tomorrow, I will be going to see the endocrinologist. I'm hoping that he is very wise and listens very carefully. So on what I believe will be your Wednesday, I will be gone for most of the day. I will let you know about that too. You take care now and I will talk to you soon. Helen "}, "7": {"a": "16321", "t": "I got curious so I'm back earlier than I thought I'd be. I looked up the Saw palmetto. There are no documented serious side effects just a bunch of minor side effects listed here and there. However, the one thing that did catch my eye is the fact that it inhibits androgen and estrogen receptor activity. I would also assume that applied to the scalp, some would also enter the bloodstream. Estrogen hormones and thyroid hormones do interact. A woman who takes female hormones will have a slightly different thyroid hormone lab profile. I don't know if this would make a difference but it is something to keep in mind and also to make sure any doctor who treats your thyroid is aware that you are using. The swollen eyes would probably more likely be thyroid related. Hey pursie, wanna tell Mrs. R about puffy eyes?????? "}, "8": {"a": "16321", "t": "Hi Mrs R, Yes, today is the day. We will be leaving for the appointment in about 5 hours. That is wonderful that your dermatologist is bald. Sometimes I wish all endcrinologists had thyroid problems. My dog's former vet did and I got a lot of information from him. He could also see my dog every time on the same day that I called. lol When I was around 25, I was taking prednisone for my illness. Prednisone makes a person look worse than a hypo. I was truly embarassed to be seen in public. I was very happy that I was already married. The one thing I did find out is that when the disease comes under control, the looks come back. Keep that in mind. This is only a temporary thing and you have many beautiful years ahead of you. If the water retention is due to your thyroid it will clear up as you begin to heal. It will be very interesting to see your labs when you get them so that we can help you find an answer. I will let you know how my appointment goes. Thank you for caring. Helen "}, "9": {"a": "16321", "t": "Hi Mrs. R, I promised I would let you know how the appointment went. Comme-ci, comme \u00e7a. The endo did not remember me and had not pulled my old file from the warehouse. He said he will have it pulled. He admitted to being puzzled because I was clearly hyperactive but the labs to him appeared strange. Perhaps he will remember my strange labs from before when and if he reads my old chart. He did say however that I do not have graves, hashis, anxiety or depression which is good. I very much wanted that fact to be in my medical records to correct the former erroneous diagnosis of graves. He has ordered the test to look for an adrenal tumor which we both agree is very unlikely to be there. After re-reading about what he is looking for when I got home, it is clearly impossible for it to be there. He said he was very sorry that he can not help me right now but that I should continue taking the beta blockers. He does not want to increase the betas to see if that would make things better because he believes it is already more than I should be taking and is very surprised that my bp and pulse are normal on that high a dose to begin with. I will await his report to my gp and go from there. Take care, Helen "}, "10": {"a": "16321", "t": "Hi Mrs. R, I found it strange too that he did not remember. I have a very unusual thyroid problem. I was his patient from hell for 3 solid years. Maybe he has blocked out the bad memory????? It did make me a bit angry that he was not prepared. I told his office staff 4 months ago on at least 3 ocassions that I was a former patient that was returning for the same problem. The medical system is no longer about caring. It's very sad. I am very glad too that I am not a graves sufferer. I'm even more glad that I no longer am labled as a graves sufferer. That was making it very difficult to get proper care. The treatment for graves is not the treatment for what I have. The treatment for graves makes me worse. The endo said he would send a report to my gp. No return visit was scheduled. I have now made an appointment for seeing my gp at his earliest possible convenience which is the 21st of this month. The adrenals and the thyroid kind of work in partnership. They both produce what are known as stress hormones and they both control a body's metabolism. The adrenals produce adrenaline and such to help a person handle short term stress situations. The thyroid produces long term hormones which handle the body's metabolism over the long haul. They try to work in harmony with each other. Sometimes, when the thyroid is not working properly, the adrenals are forced to work much harder and they get tired. It's not always the case but it does sometimes happen. I do believe that that is what you may have been reading about. An adrenal tumor on the other hand, which is called a pheochromocytoma, produces too much hormone and can sometimes be very similar in symptoms to an overactive thyroid. However, if I had one of those, after all these years of taking beta blockers, which all the medical literature that I have ever read state that they can not be taken alone with an adrenal tumor, I probably would not be here today to explain it to you. Sometimes doctors don't think either. Sometimes I find it hard to believe that they went to school for so long. I wonder what they really did learn Thank you for your kind words. They do help. How are you feeling? Hugs, Helen "}, "11": {"a": "16321", "t": "Hi Mrs. R Today is my birthday for you. Tomorrow is my birthday for me. I guess with friends all over the world, I am able to enjoy a very long birthday indeed. I am so glad to hear that you are feeling better. I also hope that your appointment with the endo goes well. I bet you are very relieved that the hair loss has slowed down. It should hopefully not take too long for it to be every bit as lovely as it was before. It also must of felt so nice to be able to wake up this morning and actually feel good. May your health continue to improve. I was diagnosed as having \"atypical\" graves in 1991. I was treated with anti-thyroid drugs for about 3 years. It was a horrid experience. I finally agreed to RAI treatment in 1994 and they stopped the medications and placed me on beta blockers to do so. Amaziningly I started to feel much better very quickly and have been taking the beta blockers ever since. Since that time, I stayed as far away from doctors as I could. When I got worse this last May, I was forced to return to the medical system. Sometimes I wonder which is worse - being ill or having to deal with the medical system. Actually one of my major problems is where I choose to live. I live in a very isolated mountain community with very few people. There are not many doctors who would choose to work in an area such as this. It is a very poor area and a doctor who would want to work here would never be able to be rich. The one doctor that we have was born and raised here. He wanted to return to help the people that live here. He is just so busy that he has no time to be able to take good care of his patients. He is very kind and caring , although not very smart when it comes to thyroids, but you must wait several weeks to be able to see him when you are ill. He also has a broken computer. I own the only computer shop in town. He will be in my shop on saturday to bring his sick computer. I normally do not work on saturday. I will be working this saturday. If he shows up, I will be there to greet him. You take care now and I will talk to you soon. Hugs, Helen "}, "12": {"a": "16321", "t": "Hi Mrs. R, I hope you are doing well. How are you feeling? I've had a very nice birthday. Many good wishes from all the people who mean so much to me. I also feasted on lobster. I love lobster. It was my gp that was to bring his computer. My endo is about 2 1/2 hours away and does not know where our town is located. My gp did not show. I was told he was enjoying the good weather and putting aluminum siding on his house. This is a very small town and everybody knows what everbody else is up to. Since the computer is still broken, I may still have a chance to capture him. I would very much like to find a different endo. However, there are no more anywhere near here. I have been to the office of all three. This current one is the most professional and smartest of the three. I will give him a little time and hopefully he will read my old chart. If he doesn't, then I will travel until I find someone who is a little more competent. I am a very stubborn lady and I will find someone who can help me. It might just take a little time but I will get there. Hugs, Helen "}, "13": {"a": "16321", "t": "Hi Mrs. R, I'm glad to see you back. I'm still hanging in there. So the hair loss seems to be slowing down? That is good news indeed. What kind of anti-allergy medicine are you using? Some allergy medicines can make people very sleepy. Here too, if you have a great deal of money and time, it is possible to get very good treatment. There are actually some places where you can receive good treatment just because that particular area has lots of good doctors. America is a very large country. Here is not one of them. I do not have a great deal of money so I must do what my insurance company wants me to do and that is to deal with this gp who is so difficult to get an appointment with in order for him to coordinate all of my medical needs. I actully know very little about vietnam since the war. It's not something that america is very proud of and there is so little published or talked about on the news. I have seen a few documentaries and still not come away with a good understanding of what your country is like now. Is it a good place to live now? I grew up protesting the war in many demonstrations and have always been curious as to what came of it. My endo said that it would take 4 or 5 days to retrieve my old chart from the warehouse. I have a copy of it and it is 2 1/2\" thick. It may take him a little while to read it. I will have a good idea on the 21st if he has bothered to do so when I have my appointment with my gp. I plan to continue to pester my gp until he has the report from the endo. If nothing comes of it, I will ask my gp for a referral to another endo much further away. I have one in mind but it will most likely take several months to get an appointment to see him from what I have read and heard. I figure it would be worthwhile to see if the endo I have here can come up with something first. I feel your hugs, Mrs. R, and for those I am truly grateful. Here's some hugs back to you, Helen "}, "14": {"a": "16321", "t": "Hi Mrs. R, I promised I would keep you posted. I saw my gp and he had received the endo report. Obviously the endo had not bothered to have my old chart pulled from the warehouse and stated in his report that he did not feel my problems are thyroid related. The report was short, sweet and to the point and said he could not offer any form of treatment. He also failed to mention the goiter and the signs and symptoms he observed while I was there. Basically because I had a normal TSH, I could not possibly have a thyroid problem. My gp was very unhappy with this because he says that he has never seen such a classic case of hyper signs and symptoms and says that even though my labs are weird, they clearly indicate hyper. He has prescribed sleeping pills and changed my beta blocker back to a higher dose of what I had taken previously in order to try to control some of the symptoms. He was very kind and very concerned. He is also arranging to have my insurance authorize a trip down to Florida in order to be seen at the Mayo Clinic which is one of the top clinics in america. I am now awaiting to hear when this will be. I will also be able to stay with my parents who live 1 1/2 hours away from the clinic and I will have my older sister close by too. Things are looking up.

It diminishes the potency. But if your dad can get her to put it under her tongue and keep it there, it will disolve rather quickly. What medication is she on? From personal experience, I can tell you this. Synthroid is a bit gritty and not bad tasting but not great tasting either. Generic Synthroid (levothyroxine) manufactured by Sandoz is a little worse tasting and doesn't absorb into the system as well as Synthroid due to the fillers and binders. Generally, these are not good tasting sublingually. Generic Synthroid (levothyroxine) manufactured by Mylan is actually rather sweet tasting and usually absorbs into the system better than the above mentioned. If she's taking the Mylan brand, your dad might try getting her to put it under her tongue. He could tell her it's candy. This was a trial and error for me for three years. That's how I know so much about the subject. Oh BTW, not taking her thyroid medication can also cause depression, mood swings, forgetfullness, sleepiness and such. Her doctor will probably want to get her on the thyroid medication one way or another for a few weeks and then test her TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) before putting her on antidepressants. Antidepressants may not work well for her if her thyroid hormone levels aren't up to par. Before being diagnosed as hypothyroid, I was on Prazac AND Xanax at the same time and I was still thinking of ending it all. Once my thyroid hormone levels were under control, the depression was gone and no more pills (except for thyroid). Again, ask the pharmacist. If there's a compounding pharmacy near you, the pharmacists there have much more training than the average pharmacist. They know more about what can be combined with any given medication than anyone. Love, Barb "}, "1": {"a": "990", "t": "Just on the emotions thing here, when my thyroid stopped working, my mood swings were incredible. It was worse than post natal depression. Crying, sobbing, laughing ... wow . . I had it all . . the whole roller coaster and then some. My brain also went to mush, and I ended up a crying hysterical mess at the doctors begging them to put me out of my misery and make it go away. It actually took close to 5 years for them to actually LISTEN to me, but finally, one kind doctor took pity on me and FINALLY ordered some bloods. Ah ha. After about 2 weeks on low dose meds, I was already improving. I could think again! My levels were still low, so they upped them . . well, I'm now on 4 x the dosage they originally started me on and my brain is normal (although some people will debate me on that) my weight is still massive, but I'll work on that shortly as well, and my mood swings have settled down to pre-period. I do find my thyroid med's work quicker, better and longer on an empty stomach, I've been rushed some mornings and taken tablets whilst woofing down toast, and by 10am I'm exhausted and need some kelp tablets to boost me along. Lack of thyroid hormones also makes one EXHAUSTED. I mean exhausted. Lifting your arm is a mammoth effort. You might sleep 12 hours, and still wake up ready for a nap, it's the most DRAINING thing I have experienced. Get Mum's med's stablised. She may need hospitalisation to make this happen too, but if you can stablise the thyroid, then you will know how much this disease is affecting her.

I've been doing some reading and with the low sodium V8, it would be less than 100% of the RDA for sodium, even with the amount I'm drinking. The fibre level is good, even has more protein than I thought (still not enough for a *normal* diet, but this is not normal, LOL). With a good multivitamin twice a day, this is do-able I think, since it IS very short-term. I think I need to do this.

I hope all of this will be helpful to you because I am another seizure sufferer who passes out and falls asleep since childhood. But when you pass out, fall asleep and fall down those are signs of seizure activity especially in adulthood which any other doctors miss when they are not a neurologist. I hope things work out better for you. It really sounds like you need a neurologist who specializes in adult seizure patients. if you feel lightheaded and feel ready to pass out andready to fall down go to your nearest hospital er and ask to see an on staff neurological doctor at the er. when in childhood did you start to notice that you would fall asleep or feel ready to pass out? what age? I noticed those same symptoms(fallingasleep,passingoutetc.) when i was grade school in third or fourth grade during my childhood years. I still feel that way when i feel that i have seizure symptoms starting. I start with feeling like light headed,dizzy, passing out and falling asleep at the age of four years old as a child.when in school in third or fourth grade i actually feel asleep in class and I at that point could havebeen having a seizure and the teacher let me sleep through class. So now I always rely on those childhood symptoms to be part of my seizure symptomology as an adult. Always keep a sharp eye on how you feel especially in your head . Never stop searching for a way to combat this seizure that you have had since childhood since that is how far back the symptoms start. always listen to your body and those symptoms since childhood. I sincerley hope something in this post will be helpful to you.

Autoimmune hypoT - Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Symptoms: In a June 2005 presentation at the Endocrine Society's Endo 2005 conference, Dr. Ting Chang and colleagues reported on giving levothyroxine (i.e., Synthyroid, Levoxyl, etc.) to euthyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients -- patients who had normal range TSH (known as \"euthyroid), but elevated antibodies. Half the patients were given levothyroxine for six months and the other half not treated. Thyroid function tests and autoantibody titers were measured before and after the 6 month period. Those receiving levothyroxine had substantially decreased auto-antibody levels; levels actually increased in some among the untreated group. TSH levels also decreased in the treated group, averaging 0.5 vs 2.5 in the untreated group. The researchers concluded that early prophylactic (preventative) levothyroxine treatment might be useful to help slow down the progression of the autoimmunity of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. This is just one of many studies showing this... In all cases those that were considered for this study had three of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism. The major symptoms: Common symptoms are listed below: * Fatigue * Depression * Modest weight gain * Cold intolerance * Excessive sleepiness * Dry, coarse hair * Constipation * Dry skin * Muscle cramps * Increased cholesterol levels * Decreased concentration * Vague aches and pains * Swelling of the legs As hypothyroidism becomes more severe, there may be puffiness around the eyes, a slowing of the heart rate, a drop in body temperature, heart failure, and in severe cases myxedema coma. Now this is a lot of information and not ment to send you into panic mode. I am Hashi's hypoT. I believe mine was activated five years ago, but can not be sure... it just makes sense because my symptom progression started then. It took five years to be diagnosed with almost every symptom and then some up there. . and another six months and five MDs later to receive meds for it. My son is at high risk and he is tested during his yearly physical for antibody development and FT4 and TSH levels. When I had antibodies and a TSH lower than your daughters i was being tested quarterly TSH, FT3, and Ft4. The antibodies were only going to be checked once a year. . but my heart flipped out and after my cardio looked at everything else he settled on it being thyroid related and tested me to see i had a 50 fold increase in antibody levels. So I recommend you keep an observed symptom log on your daughter and possibly getting testing more frequent than yearly. Get a BP machine for home and taking daily BP , HR, and temperatures. Her body will tell you by delayed growth, weight gain, and many other symptoms that hormone levels are not right. When i was at a TSH of 1.6 my FT4 levels were at 5%. . this made my body flip out. But we are all different. My son is five he has a FT4 in the 20% range and his TSH is 5. Right now they are holding on him. I wish I knew what the optimal TSH is for a child his age. . but I have yet to dig that fact up. Optimal FT3 and Ft4 levels are 50-80%. Same for T4 and T3. . but birth control pills and diet can affect T4 and T3 tests which have 20% error to them to start with... What is the range on that T4? Also take note that the TSH accepted range is 0.3-3.0, but many thyroid savy MDs note a TSH of 2-2.5 to be a possible sign of thyroid failure. Hashi's sufferers thanks to TPOAb binding can also never get out of normal range and still be hypoT. Our antibodies sometimes interfere with TSH production. Welcome to the board. I am so glad the your daughter was diagnosed early and is being watched over carefully.

If I am correct than the only way you don't have them anymore is if you thyroid is dead from the disease or if it is removed. I had hairloss before I had my thyroid removed, even though my thyroid blood tests were all in \"normal\" range. I Feel all the problems I had with high blood pressure, fatigue, headaches, backaches were all related to the antibodies. I say this because now that my gland is gone, all these symptoms are gone. I too was just diagnosed with IBS but...... During the testing to figure out what is going on they found an orange sized mass in my pelvis, now I don't know if this is related to my IBS-D or not but suspect that it might be since they popped up at the same time. I think I had IBS-C my whole life before that, but it could have been thyroid related. Have you had an ultrasound or any other tests on your pelvis to see exactly what is going on in there? You mentioned bad PMS and this can be a sign of cysts or problems in that area. For IBS-C I was told that zelnorm is a great medicine. I can't take it since I am mostly D right now and it can cause D to be worse. Wish I could take it because I hate my antispaz meds, they dry me out. If I ever switch to C again I will take it. I remember when I was C and it seemed like fiber didn't work but I either wasn't drinking enough water or I didn't give it long enough to kick in.

I was just sharing my experience with IBS with you. I thought perhaps that if you hadn't hit menopause yet, that it could be a cyst or something causing your IBS. Unfortuantely sometimes IBS just pops up. I was diagnosed with hashimotos through a needle biopsy. Normally people are diagnosed through their antibodies test, but mine were negative. I don't know how it's possible, and apparently the doctors don't know all there is to know about this disease. It is frustrating, I had to fight for a diagnosis because everything was \"normal\" all the time, even though I felt like absolute crap. I was even put on anti-anxiety drugs because the doctor thought it was all in my head. Doctors rely too much on the magical numbers on the blood tests. Not everyone is the same. I agree that you should get your Iron checked. If you are feeling that bad than I would think that your doctor would want to find out what's wrong by running more tests.

I would like to know if the increase in heart rate is something to be concerned about? In regards to the DHEA, the source of the info I gave you regarding hair loss, never mentions hirsutism as a side effect in women. I do not have any signs of hirsutism. One thyroid source (mary shalmon?) suggests the problem lies with testosterone and it's conversion to DHT in the hair follicles...causing hair loss. This person suggests evening primrose to help with this problem. I have tried Borage oil for 1 month but notice no help. I am aware that primrose oil apparently differs in that it is a phytoestrogen. Is this why it works? Does it matter what type of GLA one uses? I was concerned about using additional estrogen, since I already take some. I am VERY concerned about regaining the weight I lost since on the armour and dhea. Is this a valid concern? What can I do to maintain the weight I am at now? Why must the FT3 and FT4 be at similar levels? What does this do to the body's metabolism? I was on 1mg of levoxyl previously, and could not loose weight. I was also severely fatigued etc. The doc then put me initially on l grain armour. During the conversion process, I started to loose weight and felt alot better. Why is this? Now, she is thinking I need to be off the armour and back on the levoxyl. I can't go back to that state! She doesn't want to bother with armour. I get the impression she has other patients on it having a lot of problems. They have a lot of symptoms, and I am not sure she knows how to adjust the armour. What do you suggest I tell her, so she will continue to work on this with me? Why does armour feel so much better than levoxyl, yet it seems to have alot more problems in fine tuning the T4 and T3? I am also concerned about the dhea. I don't want to go off of it, it seems to help me so much. What about 7-keto dhea? Do you have any experience with this? My other doc put me on dhea because my own values were so low, and as a preventive measure for osteoporosis. When I started having hair loss (very concerned about it) and increased heart rate, she took off on me. I can't afford to loose another doctor. PLEASE HELP. If you could answer the questions I have posed, and try to explain, and deal with the concerns I have voiced, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks! binks I hope to hear from you soon. "}, "3": {"a": "93445", "t": "MEEP- Thanks for your time and responses. In answer to your question about the time I took my meds (thyroid only?) , yes, it was within 6 hours before I had my lab tests. Also, I wanted to ask you about the hydrocortisone again. If you will please look over my original comments, it would help. I need to know what tests, if any, need to be performed. Have you heard of Dr. MCJeffries and his book,\"Safe Uses of Cortisol\"? What do you think? Are the side-effects of physiological doses of hydrocortisone the same, or similar to prednisone like steroids? Dr. McJeffries thinks they are not, yet my pcp tells me different. I don't know what to believe. It is after I started taking the hydrocortisone, I began to gain weight and developed severe fibromyalgia with severe fatigue. I read over a site by Dr. Shames. He is supposedly is a family practioner who specializes in treating thyroid. He states it is important to balance the thyroid and adrenals. How does one do this? Also, I would like to know how estrogen and progesterone effect thyroid levels? (I am taking natural progesterone cream and estradiol (biest)). What is the best way to take DHEA? Is a once a day regime ok? Would it be better to split the dose and take 2 x per day? I would appreciate if you could research the DHEA, and tell me what you come up with. Also, what can I do to help with hair loss, in addition to balancing the thyroid, and possibly the DHEA? (My pcp is very opposed to taking too many lab tests, and is resistant to testing for other hormone level changes when testing again for the thyroid. What do you think about this? How can I get what I need from her? I look forward to hearing from you again. binks "}, "4": {"a": "93445", "t": "MEEP- The doc pretty much left the hydro levels to me. I tested low for cortisol in the am. So...what is the best dosage regime for me to follow? Did you gain weight after taking the hydrocortisone as well? If so, what is a reasonable amount to expect? According to Jeffries, one shouldn't gain weight. He suggested I take 5mg x 4. The original doc who prescribed the hydro had me taking a total of about 15mgs/day in divided doses of four. I didn't seem to gain weight on this dose. It was only after I started raising this dose, I began to have weight gain. Then she split in midtreatment, and I was left floundering around. The pcp I have handling it now, isn't really doing anything to address the dosage. Thinks weight gain is a normal reaction to this steroid. She doesn't know about Jeffries. I told her, and it still didn't change her attitude. No one has ever addressed the issue again with me test wise. I told you I was under the impression the adrenals should be balanced with the thyroid. What do you think? How does one do this? I told you what I am currently taking now. This caused a 30 lb. weight gain. It was only after this,the pcp told me to take some levoxyl for several years, till I was soo sick with chronic fatigue , could not get out of bed, and fibro, she finally agreed to try me on armour. She had insisted all along priviously, ,there was no such thing as free T3! She still tells me this. She only has T3uptake listed. I have to force the T3 issue, to get tested. I need to know what are the best doses to take that will not cause much weight gain and the best time to take them. I used to take my hydro earlier than 9pm, but found I was getting too tired very early. Now, I still remain a night person. I can't seem to get to bed till 1am, and then have a lot of difficulty in the am. I feel like I was run over by a truck. I feel very tired. All I want to do is sleep. What possibly is wrong with this picture, and what can I do about it?I was able to take lab test today for T3,T4,TSH and DHEA. I took the tests 8 hrs. after taking the thyroid. According to the last lab figures I gave you,what does that make me? Hypo or Hyper? Will adding more T4 and having the levels equal, tend to cause me to gain weight? How much T4 and T3 are in 1 grain of armour? How does it compare to 1 mg. of Levoxyl? In answer to your question, I started to take the hydrocortisone at the same time I started the Biest, progesterone cream and testosterone cream. My weight didn't start to shift up till I was told to increase the hydrocortisone from the l5mgs. I felt I couldn't stay at this dose, because I began to feel severe fatigue as the cortisol was wearing off too soon , I think. I could not wait till the next dose. No one ever suggested I take thyroid, inspite of the fact I have a pst hx of Hashimoto's and have developed a lot of problems since stopping the original thyroid. I stopped, because I was told I did not have any more antibodies, and the TSH was in the middle range. I was full of fatigue, vasospasms and severe PMS, as well as IBS, which I continue to have, inspite of taking the hormones I am on now. I have tried a lot of things. Nothing seems to really help for long . I don't know what this is from . I have the C type. No seems able to address this problem, other than to tell me to take laxatives, increase fiber and take ascidopholous. I can't take fiber. Makes things much worse.

It is interesting to note the last reply I received from a senior moderator, mentions she had IBS and it was gone after she had her thyroid removed. Also, I don't understand. Perhaps you can help explain this to me. She mentioned she had Hashimoto's but her antibodies didn't show up on the lab work. How can this be? If this is correct, perhaps that is going on with me as well. However, I have never heard of this before. Perhaps, you and she could elaborate more on this particular topic as well. I USED to have SEVERE pms before I hit menopause. I went through hell each month. It was impossible for me to work on top of this and everything else. I had SEVERE cramps, ,mood problems. The situation was predictable, and often would start 2 weeks before my period, and then into it's first week. I could pretty much count on being incapacitated each month. While I was still on thyroid for the Hashimotos, an endocrinologist put me on massive doses of micronized progesterone. I must say, it really helped. However, this doc gave up his practice to return to research, and I was left without anyone to help carry on his treatment with me. Then, I went off the thyroid and then the progesterone. I think my body went into shock, as nothing seemed to work right in my body after that. I just got sicker.I was also told I was allergic to my own progesterone and estrogen by an Environmental Immunolgist. I also feel my adrenals really went down hill.I was then told I had Lupus. After a round with some Lupus meds, and a form of chemotherapy, I was now told I did not have Lupus, but rather, Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease! I am not sure they really know what is going one now. ( I am chemically sensitive and very sensitive to most meds) No one seemed interested in what the previous docs had done regarding my hormones and the problems I was having. They basically made light of the whole thing, and for a better part of 10 years I suffered greatly. It wasn't till I was at the brink of menopause, and was put on natural hormones and the hydrocortisone, that I began to feel somewhat better...until the severe fatigue and fibro set in...and I was pretty much bed ridden again. I did not have the medical care I think I needed. It was impossible for me to get! Thanks so much.

Also, with adrenal fatigue, your TSH rarely if ever gets elevated. Mine was 2.6 when I was diagnosed. On the IBS, I really don't know what to tell you. Perhaps someone else woudl have better advice there. Getting all your hormones levelled out might help quite a bit, though. Taking the hormones doesn't mean you are balancing them properly for what your body needs. Hashimoto's patient's do not necessarily have antibodies, but they usually do. The only way to TRULY diagnose Hashimoto's is to biopsy thyroid tissue like what she had done. Any doctor that diagnoses Hashimoto's based on antibodies is only guessing. Antibodies do not mean Hashimoto's and Hashimoto's does not necessarily mean antibodies. That is often a symptom of hypothyroidism, too. The stress of stopping ANY hormone therapy suddenly can make the body do terrible things. I hate that you had to go though that. SO how can you take supplements that have bioidentical hormones? I dont' buy that diagnosis. That's what happens when your body is shocked by sudden changees in hormone levels. The adrenals keep up for a while, then just peter out and then you have symmptoms frmo that, too. I am sorry to hear that. Welcome to the club! Many of us here have had misdiagnosis after misdiagnosis, some of them even potentially fatal. At least because we all have our horror stories we can understand the agony and the frustration of it all can at least share our compassion and heartfelt support. This is very common with adrenal fatigue... Again, I Am sorry you had to endure all that. Sadly, that is the case for many.

"}, "1": {"a": "3243", "t": "You've clearly inherited the family hypoT curse. TSH consistently above 2 is the first red flag. Your FT4 is below mid-range (which would be 1.3 on the .8-1.8 range). Your FT3 is range, for cripes sake. Has no MD ever mentioned that to you?!? Probably more than 98% of women who eventually get a hypoT diagnosis have FTs still within the range. It takes a long-standing case to produce one or both FT levels so low as yours. The treatment is replacement of the hormones your gland can no longer produce with one(s) from a prescription. Synthroid (or other brand) is T4. It's sufficient treatment for most people, as long as enough T4 converts to T3 for the body's use. Other people don't convert T4 to T3 efficiently; it appears you may be one, given how low your T3 is in comparison to your T4 level. For them, the addition of Cytomel (synthetic T3) to the synthetic T4 solves the problem. But for many others, natural dessicated porcine thyroid (such as Armour or NP thyroid) is a less expensive, better alternative. Before all else, thyroid treatment is what I'd pursue in your case. If you do have weak adrenals, though, understand that they must be treated before or concurrently with thyroid replacement. Weak adrenals prevent the cells from making use of the thyroid replacement. Again... I don't know much about adrenals. That's about the extent of my knowledge about them. If you're having trouble getting diagnosed, does your father have a great thyroid doctor you can consult? PS: Your sister may not be as \"borderline\" as you both think. MDs are notoriously terrible at diagnosing and treating this disease, so it's entirely possible she'd benefit from treatment as much as you would. "}, "2": {"a": "3243", "t": "(You can use the \"Quick Reply\" button to keep from quoting the entire post you're responding to. Saves space and my scroll wheel ) Simply discontinuing the estrogen BC won't solve the problem. It might serve to lower the total T4 (which is in no way the problem anyway), and it won't boost your free T3 (which is almost assuredly of the problem). Besides, an unplanned pregnancy certainly is going to complicate matters a heck of a lot. Most people entering thyroid treatment don't find the hypo-induced weight gain to magically melt away without effort. As you say, it will probably make your \"work be more productive\". In the days before hypothyroidism was understood or treatable, many hypothyroid people ended up in insane asylums because of the mental effects it caused. your anxiety/depression are caused by low T4/T3 [probable!] , they will almost certainly improve with optimal thyroid replacement. Expect it. You will most probably have to take thyroid replacement for the rest of your life, it's true. But, isn't that better than having virtually no useful life to live? Besides, thyroid meds aren't \"medications\" like other Big Pharma designer drugs. They don't alter the way your body is supposed to work. They are which your own body would produce if it could. You're meant to have them, can't get along without them. It should be a criminal offense for MDs to prescribe the Big Pharma crap without first trying to eradicate the root cause simply with a daily dose of thyroid hormone. But sadly, it isn't. And so it goes. sigh I'm a \"lay expert\" only, born of experience. In 2003, I began having odd, \"unclassic\" hypoT symptoms, which - without the help of my then PCP - I had to figure out for myself with the help of the internet. When I asked him for a TSH screening test, he actually refused and whipped out his prescription pad to Rx for the symptoms. I refused the scripts and insisted on the TSH test. When it came back at 4.83, I knew that was hypothyroid. He said it was completely normal (high end of the range was 5.0 ) With the help of the good folks on this board then, I took matters into my own hands and went on to find real help, and I'm well today because of my persistence. I continue to educate myself to the extent I'm able to understand, and I pledged once I was well that I'd try to share what I've learned with those who can't get a diagnosis and proper treatment. My ignorance about adrenal dysfunction is only the result of my not having had a problem with it. I do know, however, that every brand of levothyroxine on the market (and maybe natural thyroid, too, not sure) carries a warning that adrenal dysfunction should be addressed before or concurrent with thyroid treatment. "}, "3": {"a": "3243", "t": "Could we maybe persuade your hubby to study thyroidology so that others will have an easier time getting treated than we've had? Thyroid hormone has no \"side effects\" of its own... only in an inappropriate dose. When treatment starts and as the dose gets titrated upward slowly - (has to be slowly) - old symptoms might worsen or new ones could appear. This is only due to the fluctuation of the hormone levels within your body; it will be temporary. As your body adjusts to having hormone it hasn't had in a long time, the symptoms will slowly disappear. It's extremely typical to experience a roller coaster effect of having little improvements and small backslides for a few months until you reach your optimal dose. All this assumes you have a smart and capable MD who understands the process and who will not undertreat as so many are prone to do. Stick with us, kid. We'll get you through the process.

You can see that your dose was increased when it should have been decreased.

I have felt a 'nothing' in my body that I havent felt in a VERY long time...and I LOVE IT. I'm taking 28mg per day (4 intervals) and it seems to have hit the spot. My temps are now stable (still a bit low but stable) and so I'm ready to move onto NTH. I still have some rough anxiety days but I think thats more down to me not dealing with stress well...and that will improve the longer my adrenals get to rest, from taking the HC. I had a very stressful couple of weeks - house purchase went bad, friend passed away and we had to have a family pet put to sleep...had I have forseen this I would have stress dosed...but alas it was a bit late!! We're now hoping to move in 2 weeks time so I think I'll look at stress dosing prior to that to stop me falling apart a few days afterwards. its a big learning curve this isnt it. I also decided not to start DHEA until I had my adrenals and thyroid under control. For one thing its very expensive...and for another, I'm not really sure that I need it. I prefer to try one new medication at a time so I know whats working for me. I started NTH yesterday - I was only on 112mcg Oroxine per day, and as I dont tolerate too much T4, I've cut that down to 50mcg and am taking 1 x 30mg NTH for the first week and I'll see how I go. Next week I'll prob cut it down to 25mcg T4 and 2 x 30mg NTH - slowly slowly is the way I'm hoping to plan it. The last thing in the world I want to do is **** this up!!! I've got Elemental iron on order as my ferritin is only 36 - my doc was happy with this and said that it was normal for a premenopausal woman, but all the research I've done indicates that optimum is 70-90 so I'm going to self treat on that one! So...this is what I'm taking now (seems like most of my day is spent taking drugs!!) : 7am: 50mcg T4......30mg NTH 8am: 10mg HC Midday: 8mg HC 4pm: 6mg HC 8pm: 2 x Caltrate Bed time: 4mg HC Where should I slot in the iron when I start it?

It also says there are no nodules of 1cm or greater on the right. Does that mean that there ARE nodules or not because there were none before? Also the echotexture is normal as before but last time they did say this is not normal for Hashimoto's. The left lobe is the same size as previous but the hypoechoic nodule has increased from .6x.4. x4mm to .8x.5x.3mm. (They say no notable change to this nodule). Still not big enough to do FNA......

I had positive TPO and TG antibodies so although my TSH was \"normal\" (never higher than 1.5), the Endo started me on Synthroid and Cytomel.

I've never found anything scientific that explains why this is so, but my theory revolves around the effect of estrogen on the other hormones. You're between a rock and a hard place. I'm with you... I would not trust a so-called professional who doesn't understand that only animal fats contain cholesterol. I would want another opinion or two about the need to treat the hypoT now or later. On the one hand, if you're relatively young, waiting would be an acceptable option. On the other, if you're middle-aged or older, starting sooner would enable you to get through the sometimes challenging adjustment period before it could affect heart function, which would be riskier in the elderly. Lots of MDs would even deny someone over 60 treatment at all, saying it would be too risky. By then, you may have some dandy symptoms and no way to eliminate them without exogenous hormone. Oh, would that we women could get through life with high TSHs and no symptoms at all! I wish you luck with the decision. "}, "2": {"a": "3243", "t": "Probably not, but you wouldn't want to wait more than a year or two to do so. I remember a woman who visited here whose MD let her go untreated for at least 20 years. He was of the very old school that doesn't treat until TSH rises above 10. By the time she was medicated, she had sufferered irreparable heart damage... not just clogged arteries, but heart muscle damage to the point of near complete heart failure. There were other permanent effects too, but I don't remember them clearly at this point. I can't comment intelligently on your blood sugar trouble, except to say that hypoT can impair glucose usage. I can't help but think that it might be contributing in some way to the problem, and of course, be causing some of that unexplainable weight gain. (It's very hard to attribute every single thing to hypoT when there are so many other reasons for symptoms; but it's safe to say that they all be related to some degree.) Was TSH the only test you had done? It would be extremely useful to know your free T4 and free T3 levels. IMO, if they are well below the median range, it would be much more important to start treatment ASAP. Those are the hormones that matter most; not TSH, which is a pituitary response to perceived TH levels. Not nearly as accurate as medical students are led to believe. Another thought I have... Since you are vegetarian, do you eat an abundance of soybeans/products and raw cruciferous vegetables? Unfermented soy is a notorious thyroid inhibitor and could well account for some of your thyroid difficulty. While I was still untreated, 2 tablespoons of flaxseed meal a day for a month nearly sent me into myxedema madness. I surmise that its goitrogenic properties shut down the little thyroid function I had at that point. You wouldn't think that otherwise healthy food could have such an effect on thyroid function, but I'm here to say it absolutely can. Any side effects would be more the result of fluctuating hormone levels rather than the med itself. It's a synthetic form of one of the actual hormones your own gland would make if it could plus the binders/fillers needed to make it into tablet form. There should be no \"side effects\" to a chemical of the body's own making, but there occasionally can be a mild allergic reaction to the binders/fillers. These hormone fluctuations can make a person feel sicker than they did before treatment for several months, until the body gets used to having more hormone than it was squeaking by on before. The process for me went like this: Began taking a small dose; felt better within 3 weeks; started backsliding at 5 weeks; got retested at 8 weeks; dose was increased, and the cycle repeated all over again for 9 months. Finally, at 1 year I could say I was my old self. I have to stress that my story is my story, and that everyone has their own particular response to treatment. In general, I will say that the men I've seen here have responded sooner and with fewer difficulties than the women do.... Whether this is physical, psychological, or a combination... Who knows? Also, the different brands of levothyroxine and the different types of T4/T3 meds can produce different degrees of successful treatment in any individual patient. If your body has trouble absorbing or using Synthroid, don't let any MD tell you that it's \"the best\" and that there's no alternative. Absolute malarkey! As I explained above, excessive amounts of goitrogenic foods/supplements can lower thyroid function. Ancestors really don't have anything to do with it, unless you've inherited the gene for autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis - the leading cause of hypoT in [edit] industrialized [/edit] nations. Elevated (or lowered) TSH has absolutely nothing to do with symptoms. Surprised? TSH is a pitituary hormone and merely an inaccurate indicator of the levels of the actual thyroid hormones, T4 and T3. The thyroid hormones are the ones that affect body functions, like muscle metabolism, digestion, fertility, mental function, etc. TSH has nothing at all to do with any of them; only T4 and T3 do. The effects of low thyroid (note - high TSH) are individual. In my own case, I was lethargic but did not have fatigue that most hypoTs do. Hair shedding is a common complaint, but I didn't have that either. I didn't gain or lose weight, although I couldn't lose more than 4 pounds with even the most concerted effort. My symptoms were more mental than physical; I had terrible loss of concentration and short-term memory that I had attributed to menopause. Then I began having chest pressure that mimicked CAD. It wasn't until the need arose to get that checked out that I even suspected I was hypothyroid. Treatment solved the chest pressure, memory/concentration problems and the rest. Your particular package of symptoms may vary, but one thing's sure; if low thyroid is causing them, they will resolve with optimum treatment. Hope that helped a little... pwhew... I'm a little winded. Let me know if I can help in any other way. "}, "3": {"a": "3243", "t": "I can't argue with your medical history, but I would ask you to consider this ~ There is no \"onset date\" for hypoT. When a gland fails, it fails in small increments, and it's a rare person who can say exactly when theirs began to fail and when it pooped out altogether. I would want free T4 and free T3 testing done, mainly because you have no other way to know exactly how hypo you are... (remember, TSH is an inaccurate indicator of the thyroid hormone levels)... and because 100 mcgs is a very hefty starting dose. For people with very blood low levels of thyroid hormone, a high starting dose can really knock them for a loop. \"Low and slow\" is the motto of most thyroid-prescribers, even for very those with high TSHs... meaning start the dosage low and increase in gradual increments until optimum levels are achieved. Not technically. Nothing affects TSH numbers except low or excess levels of thyroid hormone. Goitrogens inhibit the synthesis of thyroid hormone in the thyroid gland but have no effect on the pituitary's ability to make TSH. Otherwise, you're correct in saying that those foods decrease blood thyroid hormone levels. If this is the MD who thinks there's cholesterol in vegetable oil, this statement is another strike against him. He cannot know if you have Hashimoto's unless he tested for anti-thyroid antibodies or did a fine needle biopsy of your gland. Also, it isn't totally genetic. Plenty of people develop Hashi's even in the absence of family history. Autoimmune disease in general has strong links to gluten intolerance. If you have a strong family history of thyroid disease or autoimmune disease in general, he has stronger but still circumstantial evidence to tell you that you have Hashi's without further testing. (I have edited my earlier post to say that Hashi's is the leading cause of hypoT in nations. I poorly chose the wrong adjective and apologize for it.)

I apologize for the long post. I just didn?t know what to include, so I put everything that seemed relevant. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s over ten years ago and started taking Levoxyl about 4 years ago. Sometime in early March, I decided that I might be experiencing hypoT issues again (it?s hard to tell sometimes, as I also deal with fibromyalgia). So, after some research, I decided that I wanted to change to Armour Thyroid. My previous endo LITERALLY went into a red-faced, ten-minute tirade as soon as I mentioned Armour ? the up-shot of which was something about pig or horse thyroid and unreliable and no way would he prescribe that and we wouldn?t even be talking about that and etc. So, needless to say, I don?t see him any more and I found a NP who would listen to me and prescribe it for me ? with the proviso that I could ? always? go back to Levoxyl or Synthroid if it wasn?t working for me. Okay, that seems reasonable ? no prob. But while she is willing to work with me, she?s not familiar with Armour, nor does she have detailed knowledge of hypothyroid/hormone issues (and I wouldn?t really expect her to do so). She has, however, been in women?s health care for over 30 years, so she understands a lot of what?s going on with me without me having to explain everything ? a tremendous relief sometimes - and she treats my symptoms, not my labs. Anyway, at the time the following labs were drawn, 10 Mar 2009, I was on 88 mcg Levoxyl (unfortunately, due to an ordering mix-up, no free T3 or T4 was done): A CBC was also done, but the only abnormal result was RDW (16.0 with range of 11.5 ? 14.5%), though the red blood cell counts were at the low end of normal. (Significant? I don?t know, so I thought I?d mention it.) At time of my last testing (21 Apr 2009), I was on 60 mg Armour Thyroid. I convinced her to up my dosage to 90 mg, based on my symptoms (primarily feeling cold). She was reluctant to up it, probably because we hadn?t gotten this blood work back yet, but we made an agreement and so she did increase it ? so now I?m taking 90 mg Armour Thyroid. I had her do an iron panel because a friend told me that my low red blood cell counts and ferritin level, along with a strong family history of anemia, indicates a potential problem with anemia (which could also explain my being cold). So, my labs on 21 Apr 2009 were: The only other thing to note is that it is probable that this blood was drawn after a B12 shot (I can?t remember for sure? sorry). And this is everything we tested at that time. The NP said that it would take a while for my Calcium + Vitamin D-3 supplementation to affect my levels, so we?d check the Vit D deficiency in another couple of months. Other than that, all my NP had to say about these results (by way of a call from the nurse later) is that everything is NORMAL. Soooo, okay? these results are normal? but the BIG question is: are they optimal? As I still don?t feel well, I don?t think so but don?t know for sure (for example, how much of the fatigue is hypoT-related and how much is fibromyalgia?) . And, if I am operating ? sub-optimally? , how do I broach this with the NP? What needs to change? The NP seems willing to listen, but I need good reasons for what I tell her, esp. when it comes to adjusting/changing meds (a perfectly reasonable attitude on her part, I think). Oh, and one last question if anybody knows? does/can any of this have anything to do with estrogen levels? (Supposedly no question is a dumb question, but it sure does FEEL like one!) I had both ovaries removed last Dec and, while my estrogen level is also normal, I?m considering going to bio-identical estriol/estradiol cream, instead of just a generic estradiol pill. So I?m wondering if that would make any difference in the thyroid issue ? I don?t want to change too many things at once, lest I be unable to tell what caused any change? if you know what I mean.

MG: At long last... confirmation that I'm not normal! Just kidding! This is actually something of a family joke, so it brought out a grin when it was the first thing in your reply. I live around 3 to 3 1/2 hours from Chattanooga. With enough planning, I can travel there. I?ll definitely concentrate on the FT?s. What does the RT3 indicate? I did get a ?random? cortisol test, but I don?t have that blood work, now that I think of it. Again, it was ?normal? and that?s all I know. I?ll have to get that blood work too. This wasn?t done at 8AM ? the office isn?t even open until 9AM. We (the NP and I) had originally planned to do a 8AM test (but at 9AM). However, there were some issues with doing it, so we settled for the ?random? test. She did say that we could still do the 8AM test at 9AM ? just as long as it was done within 2 hours of me getting out of bed (i.e., I have to get up no earlier than 7AM). Have you ever heard of this? And about the T4 to T3 conversion - I?d like to be able to learn more and, preferably (? hopefully?) , be able to explain it to my NP. Is there some place I can get more info or that I can send her to get more info? That would be my first preference, since I need to see her for other issues than thyroid and I'm trying to establish a trust-relationship with her. But, again, I would certainly be willing to go to Chattanooga if I can?t get help locally. I?d never heard of ?Integrative Medicine?... at least not until you mentioned it. I think there?s a ?Center of Integrative Medicine? in Knoxville and one in Johnson City ? both closer to me. What should I look for as far as philosophy or knowledge (and taking my insurance )? sophiesmom59: It?s good to know someone is getting good results with transdermal estro. I had most of my uterus and both ovaries removed - there's about a half inch of uterus that is attached to the cervix that I still have. Right after I had surgery, I was on Vivelle patch - I think that?s a bio-identical estrogen, but am not certain. However, due to expense and an allergic reaction to the adhesive in the patch, my OB/gyn put me on the generic estradiol pill (1 mg). Though I don?t have a genetic marker for blood clots, I have had DVT (due to long hospital stay in 2007) and there?s a strong family history of them. Though there?s no ?direct line? family connection to breast cancer, my first cousin (mother?s side) died of it at age forty-something. And there are other forms of cancer - lung, colon, brain, etc - in the direct line. So, being on the ?paranoid?-side, I have to admit I'm a little concerned. What can I say? Also, since I have? what would you call it? A ?nubbin? of uterus left, do I need be concerned about progesterone? Geez! Does it ever seem to you like the questions never end (if not your own, then someone else?s? like me)? herekittykitty: Well, it?s good to know at least something is working right? that is what the RDW means? right? I took the one-time shot of B12 to see if it would help with my chronic tiredness (under the assumption that the fatigue is more fibro-related, not thyroid). Yet another ailment in the family history is malabsorption of B12 (two sisters), so it seemed worth a try. I am post-menopausal and am taking 1 mg of estradiol that the OB/gyn prescribed for me. My ?total estrogen? was checked on Mar 10th - it was 115.0. As the reference range for post-menopausal is <40.0 pg/mL, that sure seems high now that I've looked at it, but the NP said it too was normal. Honestly, I don't think either one of us really paid much attention to it, as that was the appointment where I was trying to convince her to prescribe Armour for me. Since it wasn?t flagged, I didn?t notice it until you asked - boy, do I feel silly?! I guess I should do something about this too, huh? But I?m not having any of the symptoms you asked me about ? other than brain fog, which gets blamed on the fibro by both doc and me (as do most of my weird symptoms). I?ve checked into a couple of compounding pharmacies in my area. The closest one offers the hormone testing and another, not quite as close, offers HRT/BHRT consultation. My NP has agreed to write the script, but, again, she doesn?t have expertise in this area, so I?m having to do my own research, as well as be my own advocate for this too. My plan, for now, is to determine what testing I need for all my issues so that when I go back to her in around a month, I'll be ready to talk to her. That?s what I?m trying to do ? gather enough information so I can get ALL the right tests done. I?m hoping that when I get thyroid, hormones, vitamin/mineral deficiencies and the like resolved, I?ll no longer have fibro symptoms. Though diagnosed with fibro quite a few years ago, I?d like to prove this to be a misdiagnosis! At the least, I hope to have greatly lessened symptoms. All: Again, thanks so much for the help!

It's not until we get to our optimal doses that everything finally settles in. For example, when I went from 100mcg levo to 112mcg (still on 5mcg Cytomel), my FreeT4 level went from 1.61 to 1.63 (.82-1.76) Yet, going up to 125mcg levo seemed to be my magic dose since my FreeT4 level rose to 1.81 - just where I need it to be. So much is going on with our bodies as we adjust to a new dose that we need to keep our treatment goals in mind and adjust our dose(s) as labs dictate. That is the best we can do. To attempt to answer your questions..... 1. I think having our periods can marginally affect our levels since estrogen does affect thyroid hormone levels. If anything, I think your levels might have showed a bit higher as a result the drop in estrogen levels before a period. (I know that, with me being on hormonal birth control, my FreeT4 level is artificially higher as a result of estrogen's binding properties - a very accurate FreeT4 level can be had with dialysis method but, isn't really necessary since it's considered safe to be slightly over-range with FreeT4 levels) 2. weight loss can result in higher thyroid hormone levels in those taking thyroid hormone supplements 3. check out this link (written by very helpful poster mkgbrook): http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=597479&page=8 I will tell you this much, my doctor told me she \"hadn't read\" that Cytomel can affect TSH as it does but, she doesn't seem concerned about my TSH. It could very well be as a result of this 2003 article published by the National Institute of Health (sorry if the link is a repeat - note final sentence): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12915350?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem 2. PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pub med_SingleItemSupl. Pubmed_Discovery_RA&l inkpos=4&log$=relatedreviews&logdbfrom=p ubmed In light of your experiences with a higher FreeT4 level in spite of a lower FreeT3 level, I'd be inclined to increase the Eltroxin right now.....there is a chance your FreeT3 level will increase. Ever since 5mcg Cytomel brought my FreeT3 level from 3.0 to 4.0 (2.0-4.4), my levothyroxine dose increases have affected my FreeT3 level somewhat. My FreeT3 level has ranged from 3.8 to 4.4 since adjusting my levo dose. And, most recently, it has stabilized at 4.0. So, you really don't know what a particular dose increase will accomplish until you've \"worn\" it for awhile. Finding the optimal dose is truly a matter of trial and error - especially since most of us didn't know our optimal levels before we got sick. Rest assured, you won't have to keep upping your doses into infinity - you will need to up them until you optimize your levels. "}, "3": {"a": "3258", "t": "I have done the same.

Let me try to improve your knowledge of how the whole HPT loop works. I think I explain this in one of my previous threads, but those you have to search for. First what is HPT? hypothalamus(H) pituitary(P) thyroid(T) loop. The adrenal gland is part of this loop as well, but we will leave that out for now. There is no direct signal from blood thyroid levels to the thyroid to tell it to make T4&3. Instead the hypothalamus reads the thyroid levels in the blood. It will decide if you need more, less, or should hold steady. If your levels are low the H produces TRH which tells the P to produce TSH. Until your T recorded the TSH go hormone it will not produce T4&3. I bet you have figured out your problem with regards to adding T3 reducing you T4 levels now, but I will spell it out for everyone to read. You still have a low functioning thyroid. It has been producing some of the T4 hormone that you have needed up until this point. However now every time you add T3 your TSH hormone production is suppressed resulting in only T4 supplemented meeting your needs. TSH SUPPRESSION- taking T3 interferes with your hypothalamus sensing thyroid hormone demand. As a result it doesn't produce the TRH TO STIMULATE TSH thus suppressing both the pituitary call for T4&3 synthesis and your body's actual production of T4&3. When your TSH is suppressed near 0 then you thyroid is taken out of the loop so to speak. Youse benefit from taking Armour or One of the otherT4&3 combined thyroid supplements that are prebalanced in concentration to simulate the ratio of T4:T3 a healthy thyroid and person produces. I hope this helps clarify your thyroid hormone fluxing that you have been seeing.

My dexamethasone suppression test was normal, so no hypercortisolism or Cushing's, which is excellent. However, she wanted to give me an injection of something (can't remember the name) that is an appetite suppressant. I refused. I am overweight, but I will not add something like that to the mix right now especially. I know I will feel better if I lose some weight, but I'm hoping with my thyroid getting in line, that I can do it normally. When I mentioned to her that I felt the best I had in ages when I did the dexamethasone suppression test, she asked if I had ever done a 24 hour urine cortisol test. I did back in 2006 and it was slightly low. So she's having me do that again and if it's low may try some adrenal support. So that's today's news.

"}, "5": {"a": "16071", "t": "Hi Tamsin Here's the difference: Table Salt: To further prevent any moisture from being reabsorbed, the salt refiners add aluminosilicate of sodium or yellow prussiate of soda as desiccants plus different bleaches to the final salt formula. After these processes, the table salt will no longer combine with human body fluids, it invariably causes severe problems of edema (water retention) and several other health disturbances. Natural sea salt [reconstituted seawater] allows liquids to freely cross body membranes, the kidney?s glomerulus's and blood vessels walls. Whenever the sodium chloride concentration rises in the blood, the water in the neighboring tissues is attracted to that salt-rich blood, and the cells then re-absorb the enriched intra-cellular fluid. If they are functioning properly, the kidneys remove the saline fluids easily. Refined salt does not allow this free-crossing of liquids and minerals, and causes accumulated fluids to stagnate in joint, producing edema and chronic kidney problems. Hope that helps. I've seen a bit of difference drinking celtic sea salt water (I add 1/4 teaspoon in 32 ounces of water in a container).

I'm back on an iron supplement (think my ferretin is up in the high 50's so that's decent and not too too low, but my doctor wants it over 100). The pancreatic enzymes will help me digest and therefore absorb protein much more readily, reduce some/all? inflammation of my thyroid so that should help. The cortate i'm taking to help with the cortisol needed for my adrenals should help. The T3 med i'm on (Triiodothyronine) should help. I feel i have all bases covered, but i also realise my estrogen is high and my testosterone is a 'little' high. I've been told they will stabilise when all of the above kicks in. One can only hope. I also know hormonal imbalance can cause hair loss. One thing has really bothered me and i've been wracking my brain over this particular issue. If hair stops falling out for a period of time it is usually due to something. Well mid december 2007 to mid january 2008 my hair did stop shedding. It was amazing. I was so excited and happy and thought my problems were over (didn't know about my thyroid and other issues at that point). Towards the end of january it began shedding more and more again but i couldn't figure out why, what had changed, what was different. I have heard that in a lot of instances your hair wont feel the effects of something you did until 3 months down the track. Finally on sunday it hit me when i was cleaning out my kitchen cupboards and came across my old iodine drops. I had been lower than low in iodine and my previous doctor, who was treating my low iron, put me on iodine drops. My iodine improved and i never went back on the drops. This is the only 'different' thing that didn't fit in with my normal routine. My new doctor has recently gotten me to do a test to see how much iodine my body loses in a 24hr period. I appear to have the inability to absorb or to hold onto vitamin D, iodine and iron, but my B12 is great for some reason. Barbara Ann - looks like the key to your hair issues could be your iron. You ought to get a full iron study, just to know where you stand. Both my doctors beleive ferretin should at least be 70+ and better still between 100 - 125. For me, there is the chance that my key could be the iodine and possibly a little of all the other things i mentioned.

Your calculations seem about right on T4 to Armour equivelencies. But I think, even though you switch out 4mcg T4 for every 1mcg T3, still, some people can't tollerate much T3 med.

As you know, we are in the same club. I have had severe bouts of what I just know was nerve pains in my hip areas. Except that it's not in the area that docs say hip pathology usually comes from. However, I do get occassional achiness in my hip joints, more so on the right (and I did have hip mri's done, which should mild arthritis on the right with a possible bone spur). The area of my hips that I get nerve pain is the area where one would put their hands on their hips on each side. My nerve pain radiated from the back hip/rear area up around the top outer hip area, and partly into my groin areas. Is there where your hip pain is? I also have a pressure type feeling deep down in there. Like if you were to put your hands on your hips and be able to sink them down inside, I get a deep achiness and pressure feeling on both sides. It gets worse the longer I stand or walk, but walking is worse. I started noticed this feeling maybe a month or 2 after surgery. My surgery was great but I noticed this feeling the first time I relaly went out clothes shopping after surgery. I was out for hours, and felt it after several hours walking around. Then I started to get some mild back spasms as well. I did tell my surgeon about it and he set me up with his groups hip specialist just to double check if i had any hip problems. I do, but they seem mild (though occasionally I do feel a little achy in the hips . . and that is felt in front. For example, if you lay down and bend one knee, then pull your pull to your chest as tightly as you can & you feel pain inside the area where your upper leg bends, that is usually a sign of hip arthritis. At least that is what I was told by the hip doc and my PT. The hip doctor thought it was probably more spine related. But I also have this snapping sensation in my actual right hip area (in between the groin and outer leg) every time I take a step. Even when I do my leg extensions, every time i bring my leg down, it snaps in there. It doesnt really hurt, but it gets uncomfortable sometimes. On Thanksgiving, I was trying to stand aroudn too much cooking, etc.. and got quite uncomfortable. 11 pm at night I got up out of bed to use the restroom and suddenly couldnt move. It felt as though someone was taking a razor edged saw to my nerves in my left outer hip area. It was so bad I could not get up, I coudlt put no pressure on it at all. And it was sheer agony to move it in any direction. And then I thought...OMG Im going to wet myself and never make it up 13 steps to get to the bathroom. So I started hopping on my right bad foot (which messed that all up again) and there was no way I was getting up the stairs. I had to call my parents to come and help me get up my stairs. my left leg was kind of dangling, while my mother put a pillow on each step as I knee hopped on my right knee up the stairs. I had to use my left arm to pull myself up as well. I mean, If I never went thru this, I coudl never imagine someone telling me this story!! I felt as if I was being continuously electrocuted in that area. Needless to say it was another fiasco trying to use the bathroom and getting back to bed and trying to sleep. I don't know what the bursa are, none of my docs or pt ever mentioned it to me so im not familiar. But the only time i've gotten some relief from the outer hip nerve pains and that deep achy pain down in there was when I got spinal ESI's. When I got the nerve block in June, I was able to walk around or stand for very long periods without too much discomfort (until it wore off) This time around when getting my caudal ESIs it did help, but not complelety. I was able to shop in a store but had to leave 2 hours in & I was already in alot of pain. I really had trouble & had to shuffle with my legs far apart. . and had to walk through the mall like this!!! And of course people were staring at me left & right as usual. ANd now since this last round of ESI's wore off, this pain is there all the time and I am having trouble standing and walking after just a few minutes. It was awful b/c I had to go to stores to find new shoes and suit a for interviewing. I had to go to one store in the mall one day, another store another day. . and couldnt stay in one store. By 1/2 hour I was in pretty bad pain and get the real bad cramps in my rear and down the backs of my legs. So girl, I know you are not crazy and I know all sorts of things can happen. . it seems like some domino effect. I am not really sure of exactly what is causing all this for me b/c I've not had a recent MRI. My last one was in May of 07. THat MRI report showed several things, but when I went that time, the pain I was having then was pretty much from tissue stuck in the L5 lateral recess. My PM only gave me Soma, which is not doing anything for outer hip area pains. My rheumy gave me Lyrica, but i didnt really go into detail with him about this. He told me lyrica should help my muscles and spasms LOL. "}, "1": {"a": "409", "t": "The PM did mention it could possibly be a bursa.

Pepper, all the meds I take are ones that I've been on for LOL forever! I take morphine, zanaflex lorazepam and levothyroxine. I suppose since my thyroid has been off that could be a reason for the pain. They say when your thyroid is off it effects every system in your body because it supplies hormones to keep your body in balance. I am feeling a little better today, I went out to karaoke with some friends and a few cocktails (didn't take any pain meds except in the morning) and sang 5 or 6 songs.

Sorry for the reason you're here but, glad you found us. First off, I only know thyroid stuff so, will defer to others in regards to your \"non-thyroid\" bloodwork. I can tell that you had adrenal testing done - mkgbrook on here is very well-versed on adrenal issues. She's not always on here but, searching old threads of hers might prove helpful. OK...one more comment before I comment on your thyroid labs Please know that thyroid textbooks confirm that each of us has his/her own \"setpoints\". These are optimal thyroid hormone levels that meet the individual's specific needs. Also, those same textbooks indicate that most healthy people have FreeT4 levels towards the higher end of the range....and FreeT3 levels above mid-range. Unfortunately, based upon my experience and that of countless other thyroid forum members, it seems that most of the doctors we've seen were sleeping during thyroid class. *But* there are doctors out there that \"get thyroid\" and it seems you might have found one. OK. . onto your thyroid labs: I'll cover the easier ones first. THY PER AB - <10 (Less than 35) THY GLOB AB - <20 (Less than 20) These are antibody tests for the antibodies most commonly seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hypothyroidism (the others being either medicine-induced or a rare pituitary disorder). Just because you are currently testing negative for Hashi's doesn't mean you don't have it. Many people test negative for the antibodies. The only definitive test for Hashi's is biopsy. Since hypothyroidism is treated the same, regardless of cause, there's no need for biopsy. Hashi's might be evident if you have any nodules that get FNA'd....or a thyroid ultrasound reveals the cellular changes seen in Hashi's. Now the thyroid function tests.... Reverse T3 was HIGH - 35 (11-32) TSH - 0.95 (0.40-4.50) Free T3 - 3.4 (2.3-4.2) Free T4 - 1.3 (0.8-1.8) You are a perfect example of the people endo Dr. Ken Blanchard writes about in his book \"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Hypothyroidism\".....suffering with raging hypothyroidism while having \"normal\" (aka in-range) labs. However, if you think about the thyroid textbook concepts I shared with you, two things should be clear to you: 1. your levels aren't at YOUR setpoints because you are having obvious hypothyroidism symptoms and, 2. your FreeT4 level is smack at mid-range when most healthy people would have a FreeT4 level much higher and your FreeT3 level is just above mid-range (but is obviously too low for you) Your rT3 is high because your FreeT3 level is low....this should correct itself with proper treatment. Now, Armour is made from porcine thyroid that has a larger proportion of T3 compared to T4 than human thyroid. This can result in proportionately higher FreeT3 levels compared to FreeT4 levels. Most people are fine with this. Those that aren't will still have hypo symptoms after their FreeT3 level has been optimized (towards the high end of the range). In cases such as these, the doctor can add some T4 in the form of Synthroid/levothyroxine to balance things out. And, to help you understand your symptoms and know what to expect as you adjust to Armour and future dose increases, you might want to read this thread: http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=876498 (waking during the night as you describe it is called \"interrupted sleep\" ....yep, pretty annoying - been there, done that) Please know that it's entire possible to feel well while dealing with hypothyroidism. I have been symptom-free ever since I stabilized at my optimal levels. It's awesome. We'll be looking for an update from you with your next set of labs. "}, "1": {"a": "3258", "t": "Most people don't take T3 by itself. You see, T3 is our active hormone. We do need a \"base\" of storage hormone, T4, to function properly. Certain body systems (such as the brain and our muscles) need \"fresh\" T4 to convert to T3. Since your FreeT4 level is actually proportionately lower in the range than your FreeT3 level, Synthroid/levothyroxine (T4) could very well be all you need. However, many people fare very well with Armour so, if your doctor is willing to Rx it for you, I'd say take it. Happy to help.....Happy New Year! "}, "2": {"a": "3258", "t": "15mg Armour is a very small dose....you might feel something and you might not. But, with your labs, it's hard to find a doctor willing to help so, at least you have a start. It would be a good idea for you to keep track of your symptoms so you can give a comprehensive report to your doctor. Please realize that it's not uncommon for symptoms to worsen after starting meds...it's all part of the body's adjustment process to new amounts of thyroid hormone. The best we can do is get labs every 6 wks. and continue to ask for dose adjustments until levels have been optimized. Best of luck to you moving forward. "}, "3": {"a": "3258", "t": "T3 isn't a good idea for you at all. If anything, I could see you taking T4 instead. You see, T4 is our storage hormone and our bodies convert it to T3, our active hormone. Your FreeT4 level is a measurement of all the T4 that is available for your body's needs....same concept for the FreeT3 level/T3 needs. Your FreeT4 level is actually proportionately lower in the range than your FreeT3 level. Right now, your FreeT4 level is at 60% of range and your FreeT3 level is at 75% of range. Most people need both their FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels at least 60-80% of range. For whatever it's worth, I need my FreeT4 level at least 95% of range and my FreeT3 level at least 75% of range to be symptom-free. So, if anything, this means you could benefit from a T4 med (such as Synthroid/Levoxyl or their generics - levothyroxine). Some of that T4 would get converted to T3 so, by taking a T4 med, you should see improvement in both your FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels. Taking a T3 only med will increase your FreeT3 level and, due to a biochemical response, might actually lower your FreeT4 level.

Treating thyroid disease requires a patient patient. Quite frankly, I'm not so sure what 15mg Armour will do for you - it's a micro dose. It just might lower your TSH enough to reduce your pituitary gland's stimulation of your thyroid to produce hormone. This could actually lower your thyroid hormone levels (FreeT4/T3).

"}, "7": {"a": "3258", "t": "Thanks for clarifying the various things you've tried....I wasn't sure if you tried some of the OTC thyroid preparations that are out there (and not too useful). Since it's highly likely that you have Hashi's (the most common cause of hypothyroidism), there's no wonder the things you tried haven't worked since they didn't correct your hypothyroidism. I can't explain why things were better when you were on vacation (although everything should be better when on vacation ). It's really too bad that you haven't found a doctor that can recognize what is obvious to us. My labs were very similar to yours (without a rT3 test) when I started thyroid hormone replacement. I must admit, I'm still liking the idea of you trying to find yet another doctor. Have you tried getting contact info from local pharmacists (including compounding pharmacists) for doctors that Rx Armour and/or Cytomel? Doctors that prescribe these meds tend to be more thyroid-savvy. I will not deny that some doctors seem to get fixated on the rT3 issue but, I still believe from my research that correcting the hypothyroidism should take care of any rT3 issues. Bottom line, you just might have better luck with yet another doctor. I think I told you I saw 4 different doctors (including 3 endos) before finding one that \"gets thyroid\". My situation isn't unusual - in fact, it's not uncommon for patients to see 6 (or more) doctors before getting a proper diagnosis/treatment. Before the invention of thyroid blood tests, doctors diagnosed and treated based upon symptoms. The invention of the TSH test in the 1970's set things back a LOT for thyroid patients.

"}, "8": {"a": "3258", "t": "I didn't realize you were still taking Armour....wow, adding Cytomel makes for quite the \"T3 heavy\" dosing regimen. I still think your FreeT4 level needs help. Re my history (I'll try to keep it as short as possible). My labs at the time I started meds were: FreeT4 1.2 (.82-1.76) and FreeT3 3.5 (2.0-4.4) My doctor started me on 25mcg levothyroxine (T4 med) and, within 6 wks. my levels had risen to the top of the range. I wasn't feeling well but, obviously, it wasn't appropriate to increase my dose. However, within a few weeks after those labs, symptoms started to ease and were gone by the time of my next labs. Because I was feeling good, my doctor didn't increase my dose. (my levels had dropped a bit - they were still in the upper third of the range) Within 2 wks., symptoms returned with a vengeance and labs showed my levels had dropped to mid-range. The next 4 months were spent with levo dose increases and, a few weeks after my levels \"hit\" the top of the range (what I later realized were optimal for me), my symptoms once again disappeared. I was up to 75mcg levo at this point. I was \"good\" for 3 months with stable levels and symptom-free. Then, I had a few symptoms return and discovered that my FreeT3 level had dropped. My doctor added 5mcg Cytomel (I divide it into two doses/day) and, a few of those symptoms eased. Next labs showed my FreeT4 level dropped (as is common after starting Cytomel - it's a biochemical thing). The next 4 months were spent with levo dose increases in an attempt to restore my FreeT4 level. By the time I started what became my optimal levo dose, I had a very small number of symptoms. They began to ease within a week of starting that dose and I've been symptom-free since then. (This entire part of my history took 15 months) I did have one, short time last fall when I developed achy knees (usually a hypo symptom for me), I got my regular labs - my FreeT4 level had actually gone too high. My doctor decreased my levo dose by 6.25mcg/day and the achy knees were gone within a week. Not that my dose would be considered relevant to anyone else's situation but, I've been stable on alternating doses of 112/125mcg levo and 5mcg Cytomel for quite some time. Stable levels are what I've always dreamed of....and are what I hope others can enjoy. "}, "9": {"a": "3258", "t": "My levels *were* very close to yours - I'm SO glad they're nowhere near that now. That 15mg Armour dose might have been enough to lower your TSH but do nothing to improve your hypothyroidism. You see, once the body detects more hormone, it reduces its production of TSH. This, in turn, will mean the thyroid isn't being stimulated to produce as much hormone. This could very well cause your FreeT4/T3 levels to be lower than they were before treatment. I wouldn't rule out Armour. A large, double-blind study showed that most people feel best with a T3/T4 meds regimen. However, many people do well with just T4. You probably know that Armour is made from porcine thyroid. Porcine thyroid has a higher proportion of T3 than T4 compared to human thyroid. This results in a proportionately higher FreeT3 level compared to FreeT4 level and many people are fine with this. So, you could still take Armour but, in a higher dose...and possibly add some Synthroid to the mix. This would help keep your FreeT4/T3 levels more balanced, if needed. It's really a matter of making meds choices/dosing decisions that make the most sense based upon labs and symptoms. I actually have a Word document that contains a list of all the symptoms I had so, lucky you gets the copied and pasted version (with female issues deleted ): No energy/strength/stamina Off-balance Chills at night Clutziness Constipation Gas/bloating Itchy inside ears and/or itchy skin Hair loss Tingly fingers/toes Loss of libido Achy knees and/or joint pain Blurry vision/reduced night vision Interrupted sleep/waking early Air hunger Brain fog Lacking motivation Dry/itchy/painful eyes?puffy eyelids Over-emotional Ear fullness Since you've mentioned your difficulties with exercise, you might be interested to know that I could barely complete a 40 minute power walk when my levels were too low for me...and I've been an avid exerciser my entire life. I am now starting my 2nd round of the P90X program - this just goes to show you what optimal levels can do for a person. Needless to say, I don't have any of the other symptoms on \"the list\" - yay! "}, "10": {"a": "3258", "t": "The inability for me to be able to exercise at my usual intensity was quite annoying, to put it mildly. I obviously understand your frustration. Unfortunately, we just can't start what we think will be our optimal dose since the body only has the capacity to \"process\" small amounts of hormone at any given time. Many moons ago, I read what I consider a great analogy to explain why we need to make small dose adjustments..... The hypothyroid body is like a dried-up sponge. Just as we can't expect the sponge to be able to absorb its full capacity of water in one pour, the hypothyroid body cannot absorb all the necessary hormone at one time. If we add too much hormone at any given time, it will \"overflow\" and cause symptoms. Adding too much hormone at any given time only delays the process. I'd be inclined to ask the doctor to increase your Armour to 30mg (1/2 grain). The FreeT3 level reaches steady state in the bloodstream within 3 wks. after any dose adjustment. Since Armour is \"T3-heavy\", I'd be inclined to optimize the FreeT3 level (let it get as high in the range as feels comfortable - definitely 3.8 or higher). You could probably accomplish this by getting labs/dose adjustments every 3-4 wks. until this happens. Then, if you are still dealing with symptoms, I'd address the most-likely-to-be-lagging FreeT4 level and add some T4. If you do add T4 at any point, you would need to wait 6 wks. for labs since it takes a full 6 wks. for the FreeT4 level to reach steady state in the bloodstream. If we choose to get labs any sooner than the time it takes for levels to reach steady state in the bloodstream, we can get artificially higher readings. This could motivate a doctor to leave things as they are....and this is yet another factor that could delay progress. "}, "11": {"a": "4812", "t": "Hey!

I think that your TSH is too high also since it means your pituitary is encouraging your thyroid to make T4 and with it at that level it means the pituitary is working harder than it should be to get the thyroid in action. It looks like your thyroid is still producing some hormone but not very well. So the combination of good levels of FT3 and FT4 with a TSH above 3.0 means that between what your thyroid is producing and what your meds are providing you can maintain a good FT3 and FT4 level but it's not going to last long because your thyroid will most likely not be able to keep up the supply for all that demand. Another thought is nodules, have you been checked? If you've got some nodules producing their own hormones your levels may look good but you'll feel awful (Kant is the one who shared that info with me). Honestly, if you're body is working hard at one thing other things tend to run down a little. Since your thyroid is working desperately to keep up your levels your feel like dirt! I frequently think of my situation with my hemoglobin and hematocrit. It always comes back normal so my drs assume I have no problems with anemia.

When I made my increase from 50-75mcgs all my other symptoms went away like my break through bleeding fatigue etc. but the diarrhea is still there. My numbers that I posted are from when I was on 50mcgs and the doctor said I was fine. I don't know what they'll be since the increase to 75mcgs. I don't know if the diarrhea is from a side effect in the medication itself or being on too low a dose but I never had this problem in my life until I started on the meds. It's awful. If it wasn't for that I'd be doing great. Even my weight is getting back to normal. Is there any way I can get rid of this annoying problem? I'm afraid to go out anywhere.

I've started the synthroid the name brand yesterday in the place of the levothyroxine so I'm gonna see what happens.I know if I wasn't taken this medication I wouldn't have this problem. So I really don't want to treat this as a seperate problem because it's not. I think it's ashame that when your having one problem fixed you end up with another.

I'm gonna see if this helps. I've had this for 2 weeks. I can't imaging having to deal with this the rest of my life. If it wasn't for this one problem I'd be feeling great.

Do I have to make a decision on if I want to be hypo the rest of my life or have diarrhea the rest of my life? If I take synthroid now I need to take immodiam too? This means I have to take another medication. The doctor almost put me on colesterol medication because my colesterol is now 233 but we both decided to get the thyroid under control and the colesterol might follow suit.

Also you could consider taking a bit of Novothyral with levothyroxine. It would be best to start taking T3 with a low dose - like 5 mcgs - and then slowly work your way up. The usual dose seems to be something like 10-20 mcgs from what I've noticed - I'm on a huge dose of 40 mcgs And it would be advisable not to decrease your T4 dose too much (or sometimes at all) - you can go from bad to worse. Oh and since Liothyronin only comes in 20 mcg tablets my endo thinks it's not wise to cut the pill in four since I can't possibly know how much T3 1/4 of a tablet contains (if that's the case then make me some 5 mcg tablets, goddammit...)

Sounds like a crappy situation (I thought things were bad over here but seems to me we're not the only ones... ) In Finland we have to apply for a special permission for any other hypo drug than levothyroxine but once you find a doctor who understands something about these things you're sure to get the permission too. I've been on T4/T3-combo for 2 and a half years (exactly tomorrow ) - started with 5 mcgs and then soon to 10 mcgs and over time gradually up to 40 (I've been taking this for... what - 1,5months?) . My 40 mcgs of liothyronine is the largest dose of T3 I've heard of taken in long term use (I knew one hypo person who took 60 mcgs but it absolutely didn't work for her at all - hope she's on Armour now - she was in a terrible state). My T4 dose is also whacking - 237,5 mcgs but nothing less is enough. Oh and you can forget following TSH when on combination treatment - it will drop - go by FT3, FT4 and symptoms.

At my first control labs after adding T3 my FT4 was maybe 18,6 (and TSH close to zero) with the same 175 mcgs. So if your hypo is getting worse by the minute maybe you don't have to decrease your dose - maybe just a tiny bit if you start getting hyper symptoms.

I think the prednisone helps, maybe it is because it gives the adrenals a boost or maybe for me it is because it calms the inflammation in my joints that cause me so much pain. When my body is fighting off the pain in my joints I seem to have more fatigue. I am not recommending prednisone for fibro, it does have lots of side effects. Many people on this board can tell you of the problems they had on prednisone, including weight gain, mood problems, blood pressure etc. It happens to be a good drug for me in that it works and I don't have the side effects except for some bruising. Osteoporosis is also a major side effect of prednisone and I didn't have a problem with that either, but I also take as low a dose as possible which is 4mg. and I go down to 3mgs. when I am doing well. I have started taking cytomel at 25mcg. along with my 112mcg of synthroid. That has helped and I have not had one side effect from this dosage. Not even a little heart palpatation. I am beginning to feel that I am very thyroid resistant. I have been experimenting with my meds (not the thyroid ones) for my joint pain and have tried to see how low a dose I can get away with. It seems I need the combination of prednisone and prescription NSAIDS (diclofenac) to control my joint pain and the thyroid meds to help with the fatigue and the combination of both helps me have more good days than bad. I have been very lucky to have good docs, but it is still an uphill battle trying to find the right combo of drugs. Prednisone is a wonder drug, but it is also not a drug I would take without a lot of research and talking it over with your doc. And then I would take the lowest dose possible. I hope I have helped a little, I know where you are coming from with the fatigue problems. Fatigue is one of the worst symptoms for me, it is so disabling.

My TSH is usually 0.4 or sometimes 0.1. . My PCP does my testing and prescribing now and she was extremely worried with so high a count that I would go into thyroid storm. I do not have any side effects from the hyper side of the TSH issue. I did however have all kinds of problems when I was on the Hypo side of the range. I feel better on cytomel I have fewer fatigue problems and I am able to exercise more which I think really helps with my sleep and the fibro. Most docs are a little worried about your TSH being so high and worry about the other health issues it can cause.

The pain was severe, just like last time, but I tried to pay more attention to the details of it. I noted that the pain was again all the way across my upper abdomen, just below my ribs, with the worst still being on the left side. About every couple seconds, the pain would shoot in a straight line from the middle/upper abdomen down to my belly button, and up into the lower part of my chest a little. The worst of the shooting pain is that which shoots down to my belly button though. Another thing I noticed is that during these bouts, there is some very loud gut noises. They are easily heard without having your ear anywhere near my abdomen. I can also feel the movement/gurgling just below my ribs. . and it does not move or gurgle anywhere else. There was no eating or bowel movements directly before this bout. . just stretching brought it on I think.

I just had a colonoscopy recently (so I've been emptied out...trust me ). Even if I burp or pass gas, there is no relief, at all. I don't believe it's my kidneys or female stuff because there is gurgling in my stomach? Pretty loud gurgling...and it doesn't move.

Even the pain after the surgery was nothing compared to the pain before. I'm glad I have you intrigued...lol. I'm always a difficult one to treat for my doctors. It seems like it is always the last option they test for. Linda, Thanks for all of the information. An endoscopy was the next step my doctor was considering anyway, so maybe he could do that, and then if he sees a problem with the duct could do the ERCP. That would work out nicely if that is the problem. I'm still concerned however about the fever and weakness. Maybe the stones/sludge have caused an infection or something? I have no idea. I'm just going to have to ask all of this stuff at my doc appt. I guess. I will ask to have bloodwork done. I think it's been a good six months or so since I've had any bloodwork done, so that might be another good next step. I think the hardest part of all of this is to separate each symptom apart because I have some other problems as well (chronic, ongoing).

Increasing a T4/T3 med such as Armour will increase both the FreeT4 and FreeT3 level (unless antibodies are messing things up). Now, there is belief that high RT3 means the T4 is over-converting into T3 but, not making it to the cells, but, the way I understand things, this would mean a high FreeT3 level as well - lots of T3 in the blood but, not making it to cells. You don't have a high FreeT3 level along with that RT3 level so, that leads me to believe you don't have the over-converting problem.

Quite frankly, I'm inclined to think that dosing based upon the FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels is appropriate in light of a 2003 article published by the National Institute of Health that states \"... only free hormone measurements are reliable for thyroid function assessment\" Now, 1/2 grain of Armour contains 19mcg T4 and 4.5mcg T3.

Well, that is a sign that conversion is impaired and standard treatment is the addition of T3. This is what my doctor did for me, never having run a RT3 test. Apparently, a high RT3 can be a good clue that there is a problem (well, we know this already if the patient has a higher-in-the-range FreeT4 and low-in-the range FreeT3). According to the information I found, the RT3 results should be interpreted in conjunction with the FreeT3 results using a ratio method. Specifically, dividing the Free T3 by the Reverse T3 (Free T3 ? RT3). For healthy amounts of RT3, the ratio result should be 20 or larger. If lower, you have a problem. You would need to know the type of measurement (pmo/L, etc.) used for each level to do the math (what a pain - lol) Apparently, RT3 issues could be related to adrenal problems, low iron/ferritin problems and some nutrient deficiencies. I do wonder if your doctor is aware of all this. Have you been tested for adrenal issues? Iron? Ferritin? B12? Chronic stress also seems to be culprit. IMHO, it seems easier to follow the simplest path (up both the FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels) to see if it helps. If the doctor does find other issues, they, too can be addressed. I will say this much....if my memory is correct, both your FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels were low before you started meds. Based upon my current level of understanding (in re-reading some of my regular sources for information), this would not confirm a RT3 issue (maybe you could figure out the ratio to confirm) Yes, you might have an underlying adrenal issue that could possibly impair your success with thyroid hormone replacement. This could be confirmed with further testing. Nutrient deficiencies also seem to be part of RT3 issues and those can easily be confirmed through bloodwork. In my opinion, RT3 really seems to become an issue if the patient has a higher-in-the range FreeT4 level and a low-in-the range FreeT3 level that is not improved with the addition of T3 meds. And I do wonder if all becomes well in \"RT3 land\" if both the FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels are optimized.

You already know your FreeT4 level needs help as well. 9.5mcg T4 is a small dose - most doctors increase T4 by 12.5mcg increments and some increase as much as 25mcg as patients work towards finding their optimal T4 dose.

Still, selenium helps with conversion so, if you find your level is below mid-range, it's a good idea to supplement. (I think it's a good idea to get your selenium blood level checked before supplementing. While it's a necessary component of proper body function, it is a toxic metal so, you certainly wouldn't want to overdose.

You need to take a med or combination of meds that will get both your FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels to at least mid-range, or higher. I think the reason the higher doses of Cytomel made you have hyper symptoms could very well be due to the fact that T3 is more potent than T4 (which gets converted to T3 - a slower process that's less \"impactful\").

However, it takes 6 wks. for T4 to reach steady state in the bloodstream *and* believe it or not, increases in T3 doses can cause a decrease in FreeT4 levels (or vice versa). So, with this in mind, you won't get an accurate picture of what any change in dose (T3 or T4) accomplishes until 6 wks. Full \"body recalibration\" (adjustment to new dose) usually takes 8 wks. All of that said, yes, you should wait 6 wks. to get labs. Then, you adjust your meds dose(s) as symptoms and labs dictate. The wait and see aspect of treating thyroid disease is the pits.

After 4 years of participating on thyroid forums, you are the first person I've encountered that takes Armour and Cytomel - that meds combo provides a LOT of T3.

So, if you really needed more T3 moving forward from there, your FreeT3 level was probably too low (and your FreeT4 level still proportionately lower)....the doctors should have increased your Armour dose, not added Cytomel. This is why it's so much better for us to know how to interpret our labs so we can make sure our doctors are doing right by us. Synthroid is the most common brand of levothyroxine (T4 med) and most people fare well on it. There is a very large number of other manufacturers of levothyroxine. I doubt you would have trouble with all of them. Most of the problems reported with levothyroxine (including Synthroid) occur when people unknowingly switch from brand to brand (pharmacist fills the Rx with whatever brand they have on hand at the moment) While the FDA has standards for the active ingredients in levo, different manufacturers use different fillers which can affect absorption. Different levels of absorption mean different levels of effectiveness - thus, the problems. From this point forward, it's best for you to make sure your doctor is Rx'g you appropriate meds/meds doses based upon your labs....maybe your current meds regimen will ultimately work for you but, quite honestly, it really doesn't address the resultant FreeT4/T3 levels achieved with such a \"T3-dominant\" regimen.

Increasing your Cytomel dose will increase your FreeT3 level but, it could actually cause your FreeT4 level to drop (it's a biochemical thing and has happened to many of us). Truly, you haven't given your new dose enough time to \"settle in\" - it does take the body a full 6 wks. to adjust to a new dose and, most especially, for the FreeT4 level to stabilize.

To me, these are the types of thoughts your doctor should be having. (and, when you think about it, if he eliminates one of the Cytomel doses, your meds regimen is starting to become more \"typical\" since most people do not take Cytomel and Armour) I think logic is probably the best way to figure out doses and maybe it will translate into optimal labs.

For example, as my doctor was titrating my T4 dose, a 12.5mcg T4 dose increase did nothing for my labs (my FreeT4 level didn't increase at all) yet, the next 12.5mcg dose increase brought my FreeT4 level to optimal for me.

Yes, T4 is the storage hormone but, we need adequate amounts of that to be available for conversion into T3. The body does store T3 for a small amount of time so, even though we might have adequate T3 blood levels, not having enough storage hormone to convert can still bring on symptoms. There are certain body systems (like the muscular system) that rely mostly on T4 and the actual conversion happens within the system. In situations such as these, inadequate amounts of T4 will bring on symptoms. You might find that, if you don't have enough T4 to meet your body's needs, you'll have more muscle aches.

And if it was \"lab error\" when your TSH was reported at 27, then how do they know it was not \"lab error\" when it was reported at 1.0? It's hard to believe that only 2-3 weeks on such a low dose of synthroid would cause the pituitary to react so dramatically. What were your free T3 and T4 levels when your TSH was 1.0? Your antibodies are high! I have very high antibodies too, and am convinced they are the reason I feel so horrible, because over the past 3 years I have taken various combinations of synthetic T4 + T3, Armour, and Timed release T3. I have seen major improvements in some symptoms, like hair loss, dry skin, heartburn, incontinence, and being cold all the time, but the symptoms which have caused me to be disabled, like overwhelming fatigue, headaches, muscle/joint and soft tissue pain, and generally feeling like I have a horrible flu, still remain. I would love for someone to do a study to see how many people presenting with high antibodies were helped by hormone replacement alone. And since I have been ill for almost 20 years, and only just recently (3 years ago) properly diagnosed and treated, will the length of time I have been ill take longer for me to feel better on hormone replacement alone? Hard questions. You are lucky to have a doc willing to try you on Armour. It looks like you could use some, since you TSH is slightly high and creeping higher (and who can say what is \"normal\" for you??) , and your frees could go up a little. It has not helped me return to work, although it has helped so many other people. Also, it has helped me more than anything else I've been on, at least with regard to some tolerable hypo symptoms. What does your doc say? And, what is her opinion of the high antibodies? Some docs have told me the antibodies have \"nothing\" to do with how I feel, and some docs have said the antibodies are what is making me so sick. I tend to believe the latter, and am having a TT in 2 weeks. If that doesn't help me, I don't know what will. Don't mean to sound pessimistic, but am only relating my experience. You may do quite well on Armour. Good luck, and please keep us posted. Blessings! Ora "}, "2": {"a": "28410", "t": "THanks so much for your reply!

What I told you before still stands.....YOU should not be on cholesterol lowering medication until you get your thyroid under control. Tis is a fact that EVERY DOCTOR should know. It is not just my opinion. I have told you why in other posts on this site. You will most likely have to take thyroid medication for the rest of your life.... some people don't, but it is rare. Your doctor is trying to treat too many symptoms at one time, with too many medications. The thyroid could be your problem period. Many people are under the impression if they get their cholesterol number into the desired \"numbers\"....they are fixed. It doesn't work that way.... Cholesterol medications are not like antibiotics that work in 10 or so days. (just as plaque didn't just appear over night) What your doctor is giving you is against even the hand out sheets that come with cholesterol medication. Again I am not against medications.... however I am against doctors like yours who don't treat thyroid conditions like yours which are far more serious than cholesterol problems, and which could be the main cause of the high cholesterol. You might feel good or even better... but that doesn't mean you are. You thyroid is far more a factor in artery disease (hypothyroid) than the cholesterol. It is causing slow metabolism and that is and HAS been know to be a factor in coronary artery disease. In fact many of the people who are only treated for cholesterol indeed have low or slow metabolism. Doctors frequently fail to treat this, but push cholesterol medications. Unfortunately with statin medications you can have severe muscle damage even before you feel a problem, or before it shows up on blood tests (if it ever shows up on blood tests). If you entire family is having problems...i would check you diet.... If you eat a lot of sugar and flour (carbs) this can have a real impact on you cholesterol and blood glucose (diabetes).

Thyroid can cause a lot of problems. They can be high cholesterol, and also depression. It can affect your triglycerides. Your body depends on metabolism and yours is not working properly. If you are having arm pain it could be from the statins and tricor, which in themselves is not a good combination. I won't make a statement that you would not have a heart attack or stroke, but anyone one of us could have a heart attack or stroke at any time. If you've had the cholesterol and trig problem for a while....stopping the medication while you get the thyroid under control should not affect anything. In fact with the hypothyroid problem those drugs are probably building up medications up in your system. I would do this...... 1. stop taking the zocor and tricor NOW! 2. Make sure your doctor has a correct thyroid test done, and that INCLUDES a FREE T3....make sure YOU tell him you want a FREE T3. 3. IF he argues with you about the zocor and the Tricor.....tell him he can look it up on lexi-comp online. 4. Tell him you prefer to get the thyroid problem under control before you do anything else. Its that simple...... FIX THE THYROID....you might be on thyroid medication the rest of your life....or maybe not... But at most its a couple little pills a day. Since the thyroid affects many things in the body, you might not need any other medications. In the mean time, watch your diet. Cut down on sugar...it is listed on the label of foods under TOTAL CARBS. Cut down on foods that use flour.....You can also try cinnamon capsules or even a 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon per day...that should help with your sugar/trig problem.

Even then some people need less than the .3, it depends on their FREE T3 and if their symptoms are still present. You can still have symptoms of hypothyroid and have your numbers fall in the \"so-called\" normal range. Many doctors, in fact, still use the old .5 - 5 or 6. (this has been outdated for years), but so have many doctors. It has been found that people with higher TSH have higher homocystine. Since this can be a marker for heart disease, you would think doctors would pay more attention to thyroid BEFORE they just randomly prescribe statins or any cholesterol lowering medication. (as it says on the statin hand out sheets) Your TSH is high and that can cause numerous problems, including tiredness and depression. The way you thyroid numbers seem to bounce around, you could have a failing thyroid. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Don't worry, medication can correct it. Only a couple little pills per day. It is best to split the dosage to take 2 times per day instead of 1. Most doctors won't prescribe it that way. But T3 has a short life, and can wear off by the next dosage. If you have low Free T3 , synthroid will not help, you will need Armour thyroid, or one that has Free T3.

In a way the people that have pain from statins are fortunate. My mother did not, and the doctors would never equate the severe weakness with statins. Be VERY scared if you are taking channel blockers with statins...they are KNOWN to raise serum concentrations of statins anywhere from 2.5 to 10 times. (and that is at a lower does than most people take calcium channel blockers). Gooney I think you would appreciate reading about Dr. Dave Graveline, a NASA doctor.

I started to feel like crap about 6 weeks after i got it... I blame A LOT of things on that Mirena. I had my heart set on Breastfeeding both my girls. . With my first I had more than enough milk and after i got the Mirena it just So i dealt with it and fed her formula. Not to mention I gained every pound back that I had lost right after birth. I went to the Doc is Oct 2008 because of lack of energy, weight gain, stomach issues, needing large amounts of sleep and he ran some blood tests and in the nicest way possible told me I was fat and unhealthy and that if I would adopt a healthier lifestyle and add in some exercise that I would feel much better. oh and I needed to work on lowering my cholesterol. Needless to say I NEVER went back to this doc. (i called them yesterday and asked them to send me a copy or the lab reports so i can see for myself) So I just left it as that. Im fat and lazy, PLAIN and SIMPLE. . So then I got pregnant with my second child and very quickly i became severly depressed, developed gestational diabetes and some other minor problems. I made sure to watch my diet because I was overweight to start out with i didn't want to get any bigger so i gained aprox 20lbs with her and by the time i left the hospital i had lost all but a couple of pounds of it. I breastfed her too and around 3 months my milk had vanished once again. So this whole time I feel like crap. Somedays I can barely muster enough energy to get out of bed yet alone tend to a newborn and a 3 year old and my husband says to me. \"work is doing this health fair thing and it doesn't cost that much so lets do it\" So I say OK and when I get my results back my Cholesterol is 375, TSH 127.13, Creatinine 1.29, just to name a few that were high. So I make an appt with doc and she immediately told me I had autoimmune thyroiditis and that was it. . She didn't care to hear of my symptoms or complaints and told me she had the same thing and has been dealing with it 27yrs and started me on Synthroid and told me to come back in 6-8 weeks to get my levels checked. I have called with my concerns of feeling like my neck is swollen and my throat feeling like its being pinched from the inside. The nurse called back and said wait 2-3 weeks and call back if u still feel that way. . So YES I hope we feel better soon...... I am amazed how similar our stories are..... Let me know!

We opted to be conservative - go low and slow as I tend to react to meds. i'm feeling somewhat better today than yesterday after one full day of the new dose. Not as foggy headed.

I had a blood test (the most recent one posted above in this string), that was drawn after being on 125 synthroid and 10 mcg cytomel for 3.5 weeks (early I know but we wanted to see where I was trending at least). It showed my T4 being almost right, but my T3 being a little lower than needed. Didnt get my RT3 results yet though.

You have to understand that the ER usually has a lot of patients, so probably won't engourage you to come in if it is possible to postpone it till you can see your reg Dr. The ER won't diagnose or give real advice over the phone for liability reasons. If you just show up there, they will have to process you. Whether you get a TSH test or not is debatable, but if you need tests, they will give them, and maybe a TSH test to you, since you are on thyroxine. That would be protocol, I presume. Just a reminder when deciding what to do, you have a theory that you are over medicated....it may or may not be the case. Could be some other cause.

"}, "4": {"a": "46766", "t": "Hi Vicki The only thing I can think of related to your thyroid, your current TSH and medication is that you are unable to tolerate it. There was a recent post here about something similar, that the person was having major panic on thyroxine and then had to quit. It was discussed how adrenals can play into this intolerance of thyroxine. He has an elevated ACTH and needs to look into further cortisol testing, like 24 hour saliva testing to see if has low adrenal function. Adrenal unresponsiveness would point toward this. It is clearly marked on the thyroxine medication decsriptions that adrenal insufficiency (addisons) can cause intolerance and that it should be looked into prior to initiating treatment. Often is seems people aren;t necessarily clincially addisons, but rather adrenal fatigue. Some Drs recognize this as a problem, others do not believe it is of any consequence. Addisons is much less common than adrenal fatigue. Adrenal insufficiency is a contraindication for thyroxine supplementation - it is something that Drs are supposed to check before giving a patient thyroxine, though I am sure it is routinely overlooked. My dr never mentioned it, neither asked me about it, nor tested me for it . I would mention this to my Dr or the psychiatrist and ask about possible adrenal-based intolerance to your thyoroxine. The poster here, stopped taking the thyroxine altogehter, and the major panic attacks subsided. As to your female hormone situation, I am sure it may play into the whole matter, esp since you had an ovary removed. I hope Voodoo or someone else can add some more comments on it.

My RAI symptoms weren't that bad (swollen glands, sore and scratchy throat for a day) but the metallic taste was AWFUL and lasted quite a while (not quite as long as TC, poor dear ). The WORST part was the hypo before. I was not on ANY meds for a whole month, so I got clear up to 164 TSH lvl. It was pretty miserable. BUT, I started feeling better on day 4 of the RAI treatment, after I'd been on Synthroid 2 days. I'm sure you will pull through this GREAT! I also only got a post-body scan. My cancer was stage 3 and in lymph nodes so they gave me a double dose (200 mci). At my body scan 1 wk after RAI, they found two \"hot spots\" in my neck area. I mistakenly thought that was really bad and I'd have to do RAI again. Turns out it takes 4-5 MONTHS after RAI for the tissue/cancer to completely die. Takes even LONGER for your body to fully heal, up to a year. I go back in Feb. for another body scan to see if I have to do RAI again. Congrats on already preparing and freezing food! That's awesome! If you like curry, I highly recommend the curry chicken. Yum! I also suggest you stock up on mix-ins for water, like Crystal Light, so that you can keep hydrated when you have the metallic taste in your mouth.

It's usually revealed by high thyroid antibodies (TPO and/or Tg ab).

There are some good basic books like \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Thyroid Disease\" on the subject you might want to look into. If you have a thyroid autoimmune issue diet may not help much, some have found relief through cutting out gluten and/or bad carbs.

Often one gets by by keeping an eye on TSH and FT4 but FT3 can be very helpful especially when on thyroid medication. The basic med for hypoT is synthetic T4 ie. levothyroxine so T4 only and the body is basically supposed to convert the T3 needed from this exogenous hormone, often it's not able to do a very good job (although many doctors will tell us that poor conversion is rarely a problem ).

He was in a drug induced coma until the swelling began to go down. His head was so badly injured that he had to learn to walk and talk and everything else again. I went to visit him often after I got off work. After he came out of the coma, they had a therapist come in and do all sorts of exercizes with him to strengthen his muscles. They had someone come in ONCE A DAY to teach him to eat again. I would try to help him if I was there at mealtime but what about the rest of the time? Well, I came in about 2pm one day to find Don's BREAKFAST on the FLOOR! And lots of DRIED UP pee on his bed! I lost it with those nurses! How could they expect him to eat on his own when they KNEW he had to have help??? He could barely hold a spoon much less bring it to his mouth! And did they not know that he would be upset if he was hungry and saw a tray of food and couldn't eat it??? After I got through with those nurses (the whole floor heard me), they made certain that someone was there at each and every meal to help him eat. They even stopped in every once in a while with snacks for him and changed the linens right away when they were soiled. Good that they started taking care of him. But bad that I had to threaten to write the president of the hospital/university board and give him names and dates of what transpired. My husband and BIL have made full recoveries. My BIL has since been diagnosed as bipolar. I believe that's a result of injuring his brain. It definitely changed his personality forever.

Yesterday she came out of the bathroom and said \"I wanted to wash my hair, but there's no hot water. I let it run a long time but it didn't get warm.\" I checked. The HOT faucet produced hot water. She must have let the cold faucet run and run . . I got it to a nice hair washing temperature and she did go about washing her own hair. But it's just one more small step downhill.

You really haven't been on the new meds long enough for the effects to reflect accurately for all levels (FreeT3/T4). Two weeks on Cytomel is long enough to get an accurate FreeT3 level. You need to be on any particular meds dose/combination for 6 wks. to get an accurate FreeT4 level. However, I think I expressed my reservations about your doctor lowering your Synthroid dose so much and starting you on 5mcg Cytomel. Cytomel is 4 times as potent as Synthroid so, 5mcg Cytomel is considered equivalent to 20mcg Synthroid. Cutting back your Synthroid to 25mcg and adding 5mcg Cytomel was, in effect, a dose reduction compared to the 50mcg Synthroid you had been taking. No wonder you feel bad Now that we know your FreeT3 level and it's pretty low, it would probably be a good idea to stay on the 5mcg Cytomel. You do need to increase your Synthroid since it should have never been decreased. I'd be inclined to resume 50mcg Synthroid with the 5mcg Cytomel and then get labs in 6 wks, no sooner.

And, I'm very sorry to tell you this but, it's more like 6-12 months before finding the optimal dosage....that's the average amount of time it takes. A lot depends on what your optimal levels wind up being....for most people, this means FreeT4/T3 levels in the upper half/upper third of the range. It turned out that I need my levels at the very top of the range so my journey has been longer.....I've been adjusting my dose for 15 months (but, just like you, I \"lost time\"....for other reasons but, it was still lost time) Please know that, as you near your optimal levels, your symptoms won't be as bad each time you need a dose adjustment.

I agree with your reservations about starting 15mcg right away.....you could try twice daily for a week and, if you are faring well, go up to 3 times daily. This will give you an accurate FreeT3 level by the time you see the doctor next.....and, while your FreeT4 level check at that point won't be entirely accurate (you need 6 wks. after any type of dose change (T4 or T3), if it's still low, another increase in your Synthroid dose is in order.

Making decisions about meds doses/meds combos is really an educated guess - we look at our FreeT4/T3 levels and try to figure out the best thing moving forward. Since your FreeT4 level is so low, I'm very happy that you will be going back on 50mcg Synthroid. Since your FreeT3 level is also low, the increased Cytomel dose should help. Unfortunately, until we find our optimal levels/dose, we will have symptoms. In fact, we can still have symptoms for awhile after finding our optimal levels/dose. But, thankfully, as we get close to those optimal levels/dose, the symptoms aren't as bad. Issues with bones/heart are most often dose-related...in other words, the patient is taking a too-high dose that brings their levels very much over-range. Or, the patient is so undermedicated that their levels are very much under-range. At this point, I don't see a concern for you. I know your meds aren't high enough.....and, yes, your body needs time to heal. In regards to your numbers - everyone feels different levels differently. For example, I was suffering with over 30 hypo symptoms (some of them debilitating) and my FreeT4 was 1.2 (.82-1.77), FreeT3 3.0 (2.0-4.4). So, one could say my numbers were \"better\" than yours but, not really. If our levels aren't right for us, this means our bodies aren't getting the vital thyroid hormone needed for it to function properly. Think of the body as if it's charged by batteries - until the batteries are fully charged, the body won't work properly. And, sorry to say, I suspect the reason your body feels so exhausted could be due to the fact that your meds weren't managed too well in the past - moving thyroid hormone levels do not feel good.

Once I understand just what you've been taking, I'd be more than happy to make a suggestion moving forward. There just doesn't seem to be too many \"great\" doctors out there.

Here's the deal - T4 meds like Synthroid need to be taken for a full 6 wks. before getting labs because it takes that long for the FreeT4 level to stabilize. Thus, your dose should not be adjusted any sooner than 6 wks. T3 meds like Cytomel achieve steady state FreeT3 levels within 2 wks. and it's not uncommon for people to increase their dose after that period of time. You were taking 5mcg Cytomel when your Synthroid and Cytomel doses were increased. Cytomel dose increases often cause the FreeT4 level to drop so, it's very good that your doctor increased your Synthroid dose - I don't think you have too worry about too much too soon with that. Since your doctor prescribed 15mcg divided into 3 doses and you've been taking 10mcg for two weeks, I'd be inclined to try the dose increase.

I am aware of people seeing two doctors to get the meds they need. Sad state of affairs but, when health is being compromised, there seems to be no choice.

"}, "12": {"a": "3258", "t": "Sorry to hear about the rough day As you know, your reaction to 15mcg Cytomel isn't uncommon. I think you made the right decision in going back to 10mcg. You might do quite well with 10mcg Cytomel and an ultimately higher Synthroid dose. In a logical thyroid world, we'd be taking doses similar to what the thyroid would normally produce....and, it's usually a lot more T4 compared to T3. Since T3 is 4 times as potent as T4, 15mcg Cytomel is like 60mcg T4....but, not really. You'd be getting the majority of your thyroid hormone in \"direct drive\" form (T3) rather than the \"more gentle delivery\" achieved as a result of the conversion of the T4 in your Synthroid to T3. I like how my dosing evolved - 125mcg levo (Synthroid) and 5mcg liothyronine (Cytomel)....you'll find that most people taking T3 & T4 have similar dose proportions. OK...about exercise - before I went hypo, I did 40-60 minutes of cardio/strength-training 5-6 days/week. I could barely do anything last summer when I was my worst-ever hypo and just starting to titrate up with my levo....my energy, strength and stamina were severely compromised and there was a week or so when I was in such pain that walking around the house was difficult. With the exception of those horrible weeks, I forced myself to walk 30 minutes each day. By September, I was feeling better and was then able to go on 40-minute power walks and start some lighter-intensity, shorter-duration workouts. By late October, I hit my optimal levels and was feeling awesome - slowly but surely, I increased the amount of time I worked out and increased the weights I used. There were a couple of times since then that my levels dropped ever-so-slightly (and my levo dose increased) and I needed to ease up a little with my workouts. My most recent levo dose increase was in early June - within a week, I was back to my old self and, since early July, have been working out at the highest intensity I ever have....I actually had to buy new DVD's since I felt the need for more challenge. Sorry if I gave you more detail that you might have wanted but, I just wanted to illustrate how you can look forward to good health if you work towards optimizing your levels. You're learning what you need to know about your labs....and you have a good plan to make sure you get results. Having hypothyroidism certainly tries one's patience but, there is truly light at the end of the tunnel. While you can't rush the trip, you can certainly work towards minimizing wrong turns....and, it's worth every effort. "}, "13": {"a": "3258", "t": "I had to take a quick peek at your lab history to make sure my thoughts were appropriate. In mid-February, you started Synthroid and were probably feeling the effects of getting more of the thyroid hormone you desperately needed. I suspect you were able to increase your level of exercise because you then started a much-needed Synthroid dose increase. Then, as happens to many of us, your body realized it still wasn't getting what it needed....and it started to complain. In mid-June, your meds change to a lower dose of Synthroid with the addition of 5mcg Cytomel actually resulted in an overall dose reduction so, your body got a \"tease\" that it might start feeling better and then *boom*, now it's getting some of the *candy* taken away. Of course, you're going to feel horrible. And, even though you're on a higher dose, it's clear to us that you're still not near your optimal levels. Now, your body is getting tired....tired of not having enough hormone....a bit worn out from the tease of more hormone....and now having to adjust to yet another dose without \"knowing\" if the dose is there to stay, if it is enough or what. I know that, just before my most recent levo dose increase, my body seemed tired of dose adjustments.....it's hard to explain but, I think there comes a time that the body is almost begging for stable thyroid hormone levels. Moving thyroid hormone levels do NOT feel good....and due to the mismanagement of your meds earlier in your journey, your levels have moved more than they should have. You really did regress when you started Cytomel because your doctor shouldn't have decreased your Synthroid dose. Remember, you were, in effect, taking a lower dose than what you had been taking when you were on Synthroid alone. But, that is in the past and you know what needs to be done moving forward....I suspect you'll be pushing the doctor for the Synthroid dose increase you know you need. "}, "14": {"a": "3258", "t": "Happy I could help. I've found that a lot of this stuff makes sense once we understand the effects that our levels can have on us. And, I couldn't agree more that the doctors don't help us much....while I'm thrilled with my doctor, I really lead my treatment. And, I don't think that's all bad - we are a team....I'm the one with the body that needs help and I need to communicate those needs properly to my doctor. Thankfully, she listens...and she's responsive. That's enough for me. I wish you the best of luck with everything - I think you're on the right track and you know we'll be right there with you for as long as you'd like company. "}, "15": {"a": "3258", "t": "Sorry to hear you are still struggling. I'm also sorry to say I cannot tell you how much longer you will be miserable. No one can predict what a particular dose will accomplish so, it's really a matter of wait and see. It is VERY clear you need Synthroid (T4 med) and Cytomel (T3 med) since both your FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels were way too low. The best we can do with this disease is get labs every 6 wks. and adjust our doses until both the FreeT4 and FreeT3 levels are in the upper third of the range. Last summer was very rough for me as I waited out dose increases....I finally had some semblance of normalcy in the fall. Moving forward from there, I still dealt with symptoms and some rough spots but, they were no where near what I dealt with last summer. As long as you work towards optimizing your levels as we've shared with you on here, you WILL get better.....unfortunately, there's no rushing the process. I will tell you this much, for as horrible as it is for us to titrate up on our meds doses and wait the average 6-12 months to find the optimal dose (I'm on month 15), I am very grateful that I don't have different health issues. One of my family members has a seizure disorder....it took 4 YEARS for his meds dose to be optimized. In the meantime, he suffered with seizures since it was having a seizure that meant the dose needed to be increased. I'll \"take\" dealing with hypothyroidism over dealing with a seizure disorder any day. "}, "16": {"a": "3258", "t": "The difference was unbelievably profound for me between having all the symptoms I had before and now having none of them. These are the symptoms I had last summer as I was titrating up on my levo dose: No energy/strength/stamina Off-balance Chills at night Clutziness Constipation Gas/bloating Itchy inside ears and/or itchy skin Hair loss Tingly fingers/toes Achy knees and/or joint pain Blurry vision/reduced night vision Interrupted sleep/waking early Air hunger Brain fog Lacking motivation Heavy period/painful cramps/more tender breasts Dry/itchy/painful eyes?puffy eyelids Over-emotional (cry-baby, sensitive) Ear fullness Loss of libido Mild depression Anxiety Back then, the symptoms were quite severe. Then, in the fall, as my levels rose closer to where I needed them to be, I had fewer symptoms and those that I did have were much less in severity than they were last summer. This year, after starting Cytomel, I dealt with occasional slow digestion, occasional chills at night, occasional achy knees, sometimes blurry vision/compromised night vision, occasional interrupted sleep, occasional hair loss and occasional emotional instabiliy - very rarely did I have all the symptoms I just listed at the same time. And, after my most recent dose increase in May, I had nothing but improvements....in fact, I was really without symptoms and had just begun to realize that my vision was clearer than it had been (and that's why I listed the vision issues because I didn't even realize I had them until my sight was so clear). Yes, I still deal with mild PMS but, I always had that. And, yes, if life is stressful, I can wake during the night. But, anything I'm experiencing now isn't something I would attribute to my thyroid. My levels are at the very top of the range which is where I need them to be if I am to be symptom-free...... and I will continue to get labs every 4 wks. to make sure they stay there. If I find I need a dose adjustment, I'll get labs 6 wks. afterwards (since that's how long it takes for levels to stabilize)....if all looks good (levels are where they need to be), I'll get labs 4 wks. after that. This is the best I can do to \"stay ahead\" of things....it works for me. I think the reason you're suffering so much is due to the fact that your levels have been SO far from optimal for so long that your body is worn out. There is no way that what you're living with now is as good as it gets. I know many thyroid forum members that have optimized their levels and are symptom-free. The same can happen to you. In the meantime, I hope you can celebrate at least a reduction in the severity of at least some of your symptoms - you tell us that you feel less emotionally unstable - this is good, very good. If you continue to get labs every 6 wks. and adjust your dose as your levels indicate, you will find a slow easing of your symptoms. Dealing with thyroid disease definitely tries one's patience but, as far as I'm concerned, nothing beats the end result. It feels SO good to feel so good. . "}, "17": {"a": "3258", "t": "I do not think you increased your Synthroid and Cytomel too much. It's not that people drag things out over a year....the timeframe involved with finding an optimal dose is quite individual-specific. Most people find their optimal dose within 6-12 months....I'm at month 15 and would like to think I'm at my optimal doses but, only time will tell. You see, twice in the past, I \"hit\" my optimal levels at lower doses....only to see my levels drop again. Each time my levels dropped, my dose was increased. This is what happens sometimes. Your Synthroid dose should have never been reduced last time and 50mcg is a common starting dose - it is rarely a therapeutic dose. If you are uncomfortable with your meds regimen right now, I'd be inclined to go back to 5mcg Cytomel. You need to evaluate your meds based upon your levels. Your FreeT4 level was very low so, increasing your Synthroid (T4 med) was appropriate. Your FreeT3 level was also low.....now, it stands a chance of increasing if your body is properly converting T4 to T3 so, that is why I'm suggesting lowering your Cytomel (T3 dose) if you're uncomfortable. I think you'll probably need a few Synthroid dose increases to get your FreeT4 level up to where you need it to be. Even though everyone is different, I will share my experience with you. My FreeT4 was 1.2 (.82-1.77) and my FreeT3 was 3.0 (2.0-4.4) when I started 25mcg levothyroxine (generic Synthroid) back in March of last year. Now, as I mentioned, I've had some ups and downs with my levels but, I found that I feel best with my FreeT4 at the very top of the range/slightly over-range and my FreeT3 level at the top of the range. My levothyroxine dose was increased as my FreeT4 level indicated the need for increases.....and Cytomel was added in January when my FreeT4 level was 1.7 but, my FreeT3 level was 3.0 I am taking 125mcg levo and 5mcg Cytomel right now - at the time of my last labs, my FreeT4 was 1.81 and my FreeT3 was 4.0. So, you can see that your levels were much lower than mine....and that is why I'm confident that 50mcg Synthroid won't be your ultimate dose. You need to continue getting labs every 6 wks. and have dose adjustments made based upon your respective FreeT4/FreeT3 levels - that's the best that any one of us can do.

Sorry. Here is a bit of history. I AM 26, male, and I was active healthy and happy Overview: June 29th '07, i had gone to the ER with palpitations and high blood pressure(217/120). Prior to this date, i was perfectly healthy. Never been to the ER and never knew what a palpitation was After 5 hours in the ER, the doc said that all my palps and hypertension was caused by GERD? (again, prior to this, what is GERD? I never knew what it was and didnt care) Details: We were in the car heading back from my sisters house about 40 mins from my house. On route, i felt a stinging/pinching in my neck then BOOM... i cant sit still, my heart is beating so hard and fast..... my ears begin ringing..... My wife is driving and is trying to calm me down. It felt as if I had just downed 50 Red Bulls in one sitting. (I dont drink that crap, tastes like battery acid) We get home and i try to lay down... I try to calm down... i cant, i cant sit still. . basically, i go to the ER and the rest is in the overview. Since this little experience, my blood pressure has NOT once returned to normal on its own. I am now on all kinds of meds for anxiety, gastritis and hypertension. I never had prescription anything before... Well, general doc is no help... i seek help from a cardiologist,, he does a 24 hour urinalysis which the results came back elevated for catecholamines and metanephrines... now they suspect a Pheochromocytoma or other type of endocrine tumor. Well, come to find out, i did the 24hour test wrong which caused a false elevation in these hormones... I find this out after two,(thats right) count 'em, thats TWO CT scans of my abdomen searching for adrenal and any other masses in there. both negative... Well, throughout this whole ordeal, i am twitchy, panic-ed, cant sleep well, high blood pressure, tense, lethargic, weak. I am 6'4\" and was really active. I hit 260lbs about mid last year. (my heaviest ever). i liked to remain fit and healthy. Since mid-June I have been losing weight. like i said, i was 260lbs. . now i am 220lbs. I contribute part to lack of appetite to gastritis. Come to find out, I didnt have GERD. Anyways, one common factor since the day I went to the ER, i have been having a brused-like feeling on the left side of my lower neck (under the adams apple). Come to find out, thats where a little gland called the thyroid lives. ( i never knew what a thyroid was or where it even belonged in my 26 years on earth, till now.) I have noticed that sometimes my thyroid would get a bit bigger, tightening my throat. Sometimes it would feel bruised like someone hit it. I finally requested that a doc ultrasound my neck. He decides to CT my neck. They find a 4-mm possible cyst on my right thyroid area. Well, i finally sought the advice from an endocrinologist last week. He took a TON of blood tests, including the FULL thyroid test, not just the TSH. Also metanephrine, catecholamine and pituitary tests. He thinks i may have had a thyroid storm followed by elevated levels of some thyroid related hormone causing hypertension, anxiety and contributing to weight loss and lethargy. However, I go in tomorrow (thursday Aug 30th) for the follow up on my test results and an ultrasound of my neck. I have my hopes set that my thyroid is the cause of all of my ailments. I sure hope it is. I hate my blood pressure being so high and having to be so dependant on all these meds. I feel so crappy. I would expect this about 40 years from now, but I feel too young. I have felt so bad the bast 2 months that i need to do this to raise my spirits. Here is a list of everything i feel fortunate for: -My Wife for taking care of the house, me and the kids. -A site such as this to read and share our ailments (thereputic and educational) -my work for allowing me to work from home the past 2 months. Anyways, back to the question at hand Has anyone either gone hyper or hypo and suddenly found themselves with elevated blood pressure?? If so, did treatment of the thyroid issue result in normal blood pressure?? Thank you for reading and your response is much appreciated. Jim "}, "1": {"a": "55233", "t": "Thank you for your reply.

Results: 115.0 Reference range: 4.0 - 50.0 Funny thing is that i had an MRI of my head prior to the visit with my Endo at the request of my PCP. The Endo said since the cortisol is NOT 3x above the max reference range (150) then he doesnt want to call it Cushings yet.

Pay attention over the next few days if you feel more tired because your FT4 will drop. Synthroid (T4) will take I believe 4 weeks to get out of your system.

I think I would also try 75mcg and see how I feel. If this doesn't work for you and for a lot of people there is too much T3 in the Armour or Naturothyroid you can try a slow release T3 and just add some T4 maybe Levoxyl since you didn't do well on the Synthroid. So you see there are alot of options you have so every time you feel bad and depressed think about that you have other options if this one doesn't work out for you. I think you are just so tired of not feeling well you kind of feel like giving up and I know how this feel I have been there many times. So Liz again pull yourself together and be thankfull that you have meds available to try out and trust me you will find what works for you. I think you need to have labs every 4 weeks to check your FT3 and FT4 until you are in good range I for sure would request this from the doctor. does your insurance cover her ? so no giving up just keep on trying you can always tweak and add T4 or T3 so the key is to find the right dose for you. Go back to 75mcg and give it 2 days again T3 is fast acting you can feel it right away so if you can't handel it ask for the slow release it really hasn't bothered my heart at all.

Naturthroid is the same as Armour and I kind of expected you to have the same problem with it like you had on Armour. I think your adrenals can't handle the potent dose of T3 that is why my doctor gave me the slow release to start out she said it is much easier on the adrenals.

Hard to tell if too much or not enough - but when I took the prescribed amount of 90 all at once - it started my heart beating faster. I don't understand any of these meds - I really don't. They say it can beat faster from too much or not enough - so how in the heck do you know anything..... Will keep you posted. I think she wanted to start me out this way because it is the easiest - even though I told her that I took Armour for 40 years with no problems and then started heart palps.

Not dx'd as diabetic yet? You haven't been eating more sweets lately for ENERGY? I'm obviously no authority, just comparing notes hoping to mutually benefit each other by finding the right questions to research. I'm long-term diabetic and hypo and know how these questions can worry us, spoil a holiday weekend. So your thermostat is even higher than mine! At 77 when the temp is in the 90's outdoors. That sounds really really hypo, doesn't it? Do you feel any swelling near your thyroid, which is under your adamsapple? Did your doctor feel for possible nodules? The thyroid Ultrasound requires some radioactive tracer substance, I've found out lately, but fine needle aspiration is a way to diagnose nodules, find out if they're benign. Other kinds of Ultrasound tests, for other parts of the body, don't require anything radioactive or drinking anything. Maybe we can find out together what would cause a sudden bizarre difference in our usual TSH, besides obviously possible ineptness in the Lab people and/or Dr ofc people. I think I already said but maybe it bears repeating, a new Dr. and new Lab gave me a result so different from my through-the-years TSH that I strongly suspected from the first it was an error, and sure enough, having reduced my T4 dosage by a quarter of a pill on Sundays only, which has worsened my hypo symptoms but which I may be getting used-to, gained 2 lbs for one thing, for 3 months (!) the next test came back the very same unusual figure, when obviously there should have been quite a difference. You need the Free's, we may have already discussed but no harm in reminding, both Free T4 and Free T3. Did they give you both figures? As I may have already said, I may not be converting enough T3, if their not including that was deliberate, which I doubt. Anyway, you'd probably feel better having something to search online this weekend. Hope it helps. I may need to look it up too, though I'm mostly cold, and any moisture, even underarm, seems to be rare. I found, besides Hashimoto's, seventeen other possible causes of low TSH, which should interest doctors, I'd think, but apparently doesn't. Both Hashi's and Graves are autoimmune disorders, and I've found by my own searching that undermedicating causes debilitating harm, can allow these (both?) to develop. When doctors admit they didn't study thyroid more than about 10 min in med school, they seem to always want to learn by experimenting on us, lowering our doses, right? There used to be myths that overmedicating causes heart attacks and osteoporosis, disproven, I guess, can't be documented anywhere, and yesterday I came across an old printout specifically about osteoporosis, that thyroid medication does NOT cause or aggravate it. Again I don't think I'm allowed to give a link. Dr. Lowe online says flat out \"Educate your doctor\", but they're going to usually resent that, right? Even endo's don't seem to update their ancient education. A guy thing or is it women too?

I remember when i was younger ( had anxiety for almost my whole life, but it went a way for a while then came back in high school, now i'm in my 20's) friends would call and i would think up an excuse not to go hang out with them, or have my mother pick up and say i wasn't home. Every time the phone rang i would be so nervous my friends wanted to go out, and i always had to come up with something, but boy what relief it was at the time getting out of those things! But what a bad cycle that started, cause as you all know it's kinda hard to put things off when you become an adult. I pretty much get panic attacks every time i'm in a car, my anxiety is so bad i don't even drive! but even when i get driven i have panic attacks, especially on a open road, like a highway with no stopping for a while. It's weird though, cause i don't have a fear about crashing. I also get the same panic attacks if walking in a crowd of people but only if i'm in front of the crowd and out in the open, if i'm by a wall ( like a security blanket for some reason) i'm fine! i guess it makes me feel like i have an escape, this used to happen all the time for me in a mall. Even going outside for the mail i'm afraid i'd bump into somebody and be out there talking. My newest things is its hard to look someone in the eyes, and sometimes i'll even geta panic attack talking to them when they are starring at me ! actually happened at the doctors twice, hence my fear of also going to the doctor now! I also avoid any family gatherings now! even eating dinner with my family i can't do without sitting there turning beat red, feeling like i'm going to die. The only times i DO function is after a few beers, thats the only way i'm still able to hang out with my friends now on weekends, it's the only time i cease to think about my fears and feel normal.

My previous doctor stopped taking my insurance, he really didn't know much about what to prescribe me for anxiety it seemed like! to the point i would bring up what to try next! he knew though i wasn't a pill head or looking for a quick fix! he knew i did my research from reading boards and what i would try. last time i took any type of anxiety med was about 6 months ago. My hypochondria is also getting worse, and i am worried about my heart from it beating so hard and fast along with my blood pressure due from my anxiety. About the meds i was on though, first was lexapro eventually went to 20mgs still had anxious feelings, then paxil CR 25 again, still didn't feel much better. Then we finally decided to try xanax a very low dose, like 1.5? whatever the lowest dose was. That did NOTHING, i was told to try 2, nothing highest i went were 4 and still not a darn thing! Last thing we tried was a beta blocker ( atenolol) after reading how it helps the anxiety physical symptoms. After reading up more though i was worried about the withdrawals effects it has on people with normal blood pressure, so i didn't want to mess around with that. is it just that i'm so far gone already and all my anxiety fears have manifested into full blown agoraphobia? I really want to see about seeing a psych, but i feel like i need to try some more medicine first cause just the thought of going to see one is pretty damn near impossible, heck even i'm worried about the drive to see my doctor on Monday and will be fearing it the whole weekend This doctor might not prescribe me any medicine though and just tell me to see about seeing a specialist, heck! i don't even wnat to take any meds again but i'm getting at my wits end! What I'm wondering is if i didn't have any luck with the two SSRi's what would be the next medications to suggest/try? since those didn't work for me? I know it's different with everyone, or maybe the doses were just to small? or do those types of meds have no effect on me? how about something stronger? or ativan , klonopin?

I can't speak on the issue of the rash, maybe others can comment. On the dizziness issue, I had most of my dizziness episodes while on the levothyroxine and armour combo when I was over medicated. I had postulated that I was overmedicated and having an issue with the fillers etc in the levothyroxine. Now I see that it was simply a matter of being overmedicated - I think too much T4. Yes, it is entirely possible to have a reaction on the day you take your meds. So, your dizziness may be caused by too much medication in your system. On dizziness, I know a dr would go crazy listening to me but, I have had to be able to differentiate among the different forms of dizziness I have experienced. The one most relevant to you, is a fairly profound dizziness characterized by a bit of motion sickness when moving the eyes...like when I lay down to watch the tv, I feel a bit sick and get waves of dizziness if I have to move my eyes too much during viewing. Also, I feel a weird \"buzz\" in my head. When I was overmedicated this summer (I have some descriptive posts related to it on this board), I was severely dizzy, losing my balance and had major buzzing.The dizziness was such that my vision would vibrated and then move from right to left light an old science fiction tv screen that one was trying to tune where the images moved from side to side rather than up and down. It was scary and weird. Now, I am a bit over medicated since I reduced my antidepressant (this happened previously on two occasions, so I know there is a concrete relationship). This time, I felt only super fatigued (weird I am one of those who becomes fatigued from being overmedicated), dizzy, a bit nauseous and the faintest buzzing in my head, and a massive headache. I was not sure at first, since the fatigue confused me - but one the vision problems, buzzing and headache started, I reduced me medication and it has passed. The difficulty with dizziness is that it can also come from a number of other sources and here is where a dr would go crzay listening to my ability to differentiate among types....but here goes. In addition to the overmedicated dizziness, some people, myself included were dizzy from being hypo, and thus undermedicated. Also, I have felt dizzy from the armour while I was adjusting to it. It is considered normal and nothing to worry about. But, each time I felt the dizziness, esp after upping my medicaiton 1/4 grain, I felt sort of good, like the dizziness one gets after a cocktail - though none of the other fun stuff. I know you are scared. My bf was forever criticising me for making decisions about my medication and having varying blood levels of the thyroid hormones. I know it was probably not the best thing to do, but these are very powerful medications, and your body can react quite strongly to being overmedicated and you can't always wait for a dr to respond. I don't advocate DIY medication, but in some ccirucmstances I can understand how people do what they must. I probably would act conservatively in switching back to the levo, if at all, because you don't know your blood levels after switching to armour (too much at 90 mg) and then to 45 for a couple of days. You may have been overmedicated on the levo to begin with. Believe me, you will not suffer as much from taking too little rather than taking too much. Remember, the half life of t4 is one week, ( The half-life of a medication is the time it takes for your body to metabolize and excrete a drug so that half of the drug is removed from your body), so the meds stay in your body quite a long time. A medication decision you make a few days ago can still be influencing how you feel. My final advice, be conservative with your medication, don't overreact - your body has plenty of hormone, and try to get in touch with your dr.

I have a real hard time with most medications for the most part anyways... Sometimes even plain ole tylenol will bother me or motrin. So I have to be careful of what I take. I hope u find some answers though and if u do happen to find out if the armour causes these rashes let me know I would like to find out what caused mine for sure!

Back to the subject, can you tell from the only Frees info I've given? If that's not enough info, it's another indication the lab is not one of the best.
