Finally my endoscopy is tomorrow morning. . even tho I'm a little nervous, at the same time, I can't wait to get it done. I know now all about the fasting and all, but one thing I've seen some of you mention, (on this and other boards) is that some of you were told They didn't say anything to me about this....so I'm wondering.....were most of you told this?? I meant to call my gastro's office today to ask, but forgot all about it. I'm not supposed to eat after 9 PM tonight. . but what about water in the morning?? I usually drink a lot of ice water in the morning until I eat, as my stomach is hurting and burning so bad when I get up, and it's about the only thing that brings a bit of relief. (I have to take thyroid meds every AM, and then have wait 1 hour before I can eat) Any help appreciated... thanks so much, Deda "}, "1": {"a": "21520", "t": "Well, I went in today, Mandy, (and others) and was a bit nervous, (the nurse said everybody is), and like everyone on this board says, it was a piece of cake. You all were right about that! (and thanks for advice too to everyone) The sad news is....the Dr. didn't see anything! No hernia, no ulcers, and I just could not believe it! I was so upset, I cried....just what the hell is causing this pain then??!! I was so sure they would find something, that when he said there wasn't anything, I was stunned. I was angry too, and told him I want further tests done, (I told him I want a cat scan), and he said, \"okay, we can do that\". But now I am wondering if I even should? I do have acid reflux though.....could that be causing all of this pain?? It doesn't seem possible to me. Anyway, when I got there he asked how I was feeling lately. I told him the past couple of weeks, I am waking almost every morning to terrible pain in my stomach, it feels like I'm starving, and like if I don't eat I am going to die. Also I get severe burning in my stomach too. Sometimes eating relieves it, but sometimes too, only for a short while. Some days it hurts badly, other days just mildly, some days it doesn't even hurt. Then he asked me if I followed up with a shrink like he \"we talked about last time?\" I told him I've already been seeing one for a few months, and also seeing a counselor. When he got done with the test, I was angry, and I told him \"this pain is NOT being imagined Dr.\" He told me that he believed me completely,but he also knows that I have anxiety disorder and depression, (dad passed away in May), and said that anxiety and our emotions can present themselves in [real] physical pain, and the symptoms are real. Now I am really beginning to wonder about this,.....I do have some marital problems going on, and a ton of anger towards my husband....ever since 2 days before my dad passed away, and he left me alone to go fix other people's car's...(he could have put this off,....it's a side business, and he doesn't have to be there), and then 5 days later after my dad passes away, (the 1st weekend after) he left me alone for the whole day again...... I cried, pleaded and begged him not to leave me alone. (I don't have anyone else except my husband, mour son, (daughter moved to NC) and my not so nice brother. My husband told our (grown) son, [during a fit of rage], (as if, how dare she ask me to!!) anyway, he told our son, \"she needs to quit crying and grow up and stop acting like a 5 year old,.....people die!!! ..... [screaming], and \"People don't live forever!!!\" (as if it were something we didn't know) Then going through more tough times with my only living brother....long story, but my dad had left me as his sole benificiery on his life insurance policy, (it wasn't huge, but...it was substantial amount) as my brother was always telling him, (bragging I guess) about all the money he has in the bank. (yes, he is very successful and has bragged to me that his estate is worth \"millions\" now) Well, our dad was getting dementia and had to be put in a home, and this brother got him to sign over a power of attorney, (and he rubbed it in to me daily how much power he had, ie; \"I can do anything with dad's money, make any decisions, etc) See...I live 500 miles away from where my brother and dad lived. Well, right away, he went and phoned dad's insurance co. and changed it, and added himself as well as me,...50-50 as benificiery. I always had a feeling he would do something like this, but to tell you the truth, I'm surprised I got any of it. And he also handled our dad's bank accounts, which I later found out, he got more than 50% of that. Also he cleaned out our dad's place and took everything that was of any value, all of the photos, etc., and left me with just a box of cassette tapes....which he says he put in the attic to save for me. (I would've liked something... at least 1 thing of his to place in my home, in his memory) I know this sounds suitable for the Relationship board, but MY POINT IS, I have an ENORMOUS amount of anger towards these 2 people. My husband isn't a total jerk, he really isn't, and is good to me in many other ways, but when it comes to that shop...it has always come before me. (everything he loves always has) I am having a hard time letting go of this one.....I'm mad as hell. He has never even apologized, [as that was something he was never taught to do] and it hurts so much....to get treated like this by the one person who should be there for me, before anyone else. It almost seems unforgivable. (our own daughter said she would divorce him, as she knows of how he's always put his interests, hobbies and other people before me. And scr- - - by my own brother...the only one left of my family. So I am beginning to wonder, (all day today), could all of this pain in my stomach and chest be a result of all of this pent up anger?? Could it possibly make a persons stomach hurt, so extremely bad like this? I also have a lot of health anxiety, due to this autoimmune disease I have, as my mom and older brother both had hypothyroid too, and went on to die of another AI disease....I can't even talk about it, it frightens me so badly. So maybe my gastro Dr. is right? I wish I knew. Tell me what you guys think about this possiblity...please. Deda "}, "2": {"a": "21520", "t": "Hi dear Mandy... (((hugs))) I just happened to be on here when the little flag popped up with notice of your message. Thank you for replying. Oh, I know, this AI disease is so crappy. My mother had pulmonary fibrosis. She died at 56 years old, back in '82. They say there are some families that seem to get AI diseases in clusters. My poor beloved brother was only 46yrs old when he died of the same thing as my mom, and altogether he had at least 4 or 5 AI diseases. Mandy, what did your mum have, hon? I think the AI diseases just cause a lot of these problems, you know Mandy? Why are there SO many people on the thyroid boards with acid reflux?? It's unbelievable! (thyroid disease causes inflammation when your levels are off, but right now my levels are in a good place. But I also have read that having just about any AI disease causes inflammation) It's funny Mandy, but my heartburn/reflux didn't start until I was diagnosed with the hypo/Hashi and only AFTER I started taking thyroid meds. But this was also around the time I started really worrying a lot, about my health. I can't help it...I think anyone would with this family history. It was more controlable when I first got it, not getting really bad until about 8 months later...or so...and I don't know why. Probably too my other problems....stress, and really bad anxiety at times. Mandy...so what new tests are you having done this Tuesday, girlfriend? At least they are still trying to find out.... He told me yeasterday that I could have a cat scan...but I'm tired of being embarrassed when they don't find anything. I really am beginning to think that my problem is all connected to my anxiety and my problems with my husband. See. even that Dr. told you that there is a connection with the brain-stomach....I really am beginning to think that. . more and more. I am taking Prilosec, (Omeprazole) 2 x a day...every 12 hours. I have also tried Protonix, (Protopanazole) but it didn't work. Prilosec doesn't seem like it works that great either, but the couple of times I quit taking it, (when I was feeling better), OH My GOSH!!!! ...... IT HURT 1OO times worse!!! So I guess it does work...somewhat. I also watch my diet very, very carefully. Nothing really seems to help. I do have some pills for anxiety, (Clonazapam) which used to give me some relief, but I think it doesn't work any more. A friend recently loaned me a few Ativan's, (is it Lorazapam?) , and that helped a lot. But unfortunately, not many Dr's will give you this...as it's addictive. I see my shrink this coming Tuesday, and I will try again to get something from him. He told me flat out \"NO\" the last time I saw him. I'll tell him...well, I hope this anxiety doesn't make me sicker, and I'm not sleeping either, so what am I supposed to do? Just suffer? I am not sleeping well at all lately, Mandy...I wake after 3 hours of sleep, and then keep on waking up more again and again after that. I'm sure this doesn't help either. How do you sleep, Mandy? (I hope better than I do) Mandy, do you mind if I ask how old you are? Have you gone through menopause already? (I have, and I think that's also a contributer to these problems) I really feel though, that if I can get this anxiety-stomach pain under control that I would feel wonderful, as my thyroid symptoms are all gone. You know Mandy, sometimes when I get out with my girlfriends, and I'm relaxed and having fun, I feel great! Every now and then, I have a pain free day, or half a day pain free. This sucks... I will be praying for you Mandy....I sure hope this Tuesday they can find out what is causing that under rib pain that has been with you so long. Does it hurt all day long?

One thing to keep in mind, is that you do not have to be in a current state of anxiety to experience the symptoms of prolonged anxiety. Your stomach doesn't all of a sudden get better just because you're having a few hours of relaxation. You're thinking of panic symptoms, or the \"flight or fight\" response... My stomach is always better when I stand as well...walking is even better. I'm not sure why.... The problem with health anxiety is that you never know which came first, the chicken or the egg. You don't want to discredit every physical ailment to simply anxiety, but at the sametime, you don't want to run to the docs everytime your heart skips a beat. Its difficult to determine when something is worth worrying about. I'm having stomach issues right now, and I have self-diagnosed myself with about 15 different things...the docs still don't know.

But if I took deep breaths, the senstation would go away - If I didn't do that, eventually I'd collapse - but only because it felt like something was \"coming away\" , per say, and that sitting down would stop it.

The \"bump\" is easier to feel when standing/sitting as opposed to lying down. So I thought maybe it's a small hernia as suggested on the forums, and I was due to see my Doctor again anyway for a progress report. I told him about the lump, and he felt both sides of my abdomen while standing and couldn't offer any answer for the stings, but he did say that the location I showed him was probably muscular. Looking at that diagram, does anyone know what those sensations might be? Sometimes its like a needle \"sting\", other times it's like a stab.

I personally don't think we need to forgive fully, but we can accept that some things cannot work the way we want. Don't enable a dysfunction, it's hurting you both. You're forcing her hand and treading in territory as if you have a right to. So, know your boundaries and respect that it's difficult to tell some people to mind their own business, and if silence works, then be it.

I don't know if most or all people experience rebound, but the rebound will make you run back to the PPI. You may want to read others' posts here regarding acid rebound and weaning off PPI's before you go cold turkey. I have realized after much soul searching and trial and error that I may have to stay on some type of acid reducing medicine forever. I don't take a PPI anymore, but still take Zantac twice a day daily, and don't think I can be without it. You may also want to read about the prokinetics. They too can have serious side effects with prolonged used, so they are not necessarily safer than the PPI's. I know Reglan can cause tardive dyskenesia or involuntary movements with long use. I am not familiar with the one your doctor prescribed, but it may have a similar side effect. Please read up on the potential side effects of all medications, particularly if you have to take them long term. If your doctor wants you to take the Omeprazole and prokinetic for four weeks, that sounds like a good game plan to help you get through the most acute symptoms. After that, be prepared with a lot of information so you can have a good discussion with your doctor if he/she wants you to stay on these meds long term. I am writing all this because I am one of those people who used to trust doctors blindly and have learned my lessons the hard way.

I have been determined to get off this ppi at some point and time when i get the reflux under control, but its not happening. I just went to ENT dr last night and i have a viral (possible herpes/shingles family) virus in my throat...it has been there for AT LEAST 4 MONTHS! I have been treated with 2 rounds of antibiotics with some relief but it never goes away and it tears up my stomach that already has gastritis. I heard about a boof \"Why Stomach Acid is Good for You\" by Jon athon Wright but it must be out of print, hard to find. I seriously thing i am becoming more ill ON these ppis after nearly a year. Reasons why: ~Digesting my food, i have to hold my shoulders back for every meal and lots of bubbles and pressures have to happen and work there way out...never had this before. Before i was on double dose i could eat fairly normal amounts of food, now i have to e VERY careful, if i cross some threshold it is extremely painful and feels like a muscle is pushing it back out/it has no where to go, never had this before double dose. ~I am 28 and am now bruising so easily, BIG purple and green ones when i don't even remember the bump being that memorable. ~My throat is red and torn up with sores, i am truly wondering if its b/c ppi's don't allow your stomach to kill off all of the bad bacteria and i am getting infection after infection (or the same one) in my throat/back of tongue from where i hd/have esophagitis. Maybe i'm possibly chalking all of this up to the reflux getting worse when really my stomach just doesn't have the juice to digest food (I am still on a VERY strict diet months later and have not gained back my needed lost weight). ~My mouth is bone dry in the mornings, salivia is hard to come by anymore (i'd never had this problem pre-ppis) which is big, b/c i think saliva fights bacteria, hence all my painful infections. The list goes on...those are a few that i can think of. In the past month i just finished my taper off being poisined by benzodiazepines for 3 years. Since being off my anxiety meds my stomach hasn't been burning?? I don't know if thats why, but i would get these awful sunburn feelings in my stomach and esophagus since right around when i began the double ppi dose in late Sept. I never had all these additional problems like constant infections (with no colds, etc), trouble digesting food, bloating after every meal since i began the double ppi. I am not sure if this is the right moment for me and my health to attempt to cut out one day off ppi's right now. Well, i'm pretty sure its not the right time, but then i fear when the right time will ever be having never been healed from these ppi's and my esophagus, etc worsening all along. Dr's are of no assistance and of course blame every detail on stress. When in reality, THIS is what is stressing me out. I want to live to see my sons grandchildren one day, ets, i am only 28. I feel so ill and have for so long now. PPi's are when my physical health started to take a turn for th wosre and the double dose is when i began to get gallbladder problems, the constant infections and now so much weight loss on an already skinny girl (not from stress, I AM hungry, but i have a hard time eating without all the sympyoms i listed). *sigh* I wish you ladies the best luck, i know you can get off these, please keep posting, i want to get better and when i have another round of energy after this anti-viral i'm on hopefully, i want to try another way, i don't feel well on these ppi's.

My husbands cousin is also a naturopathic dr in another state and conferred (sp?) with this dr.'s opinion independently. Basically, they said they are seeing alot of people whom for various reasons get on ppi's, but then develop worse symptoms or side effects, etc. Ppi's encourage gastroparesis since you have such a lack of stomach acid, which is happening to me, when there isn't a proper ph balance in my stomach, the duoedoum (sp?) won't open correctly allowing fermenting gases up the esopahgus through the LES. There is much more to it. Also, my constant throat/skin infections DEFINITELY are related to ppi's. I knew it, they have been improving (knock on wood) since cutting down to 20 mg prilosec a day. For someone whom has had esophagitis everyday for so many months, coming off ppi's has been, torturous to say the least....but i now have lost 30 lbs!! during my ppi therapy since last July...NOT good, under 110 now.

You will not have to take the antiviral medicine permanently and there is no rebound effect from those meds that I know or have ever heard of. I think stress definitely aggravates the GI problems and probably contributes to the viral/shingles outbreaks too. Reading through your post, it sounds like if you can get rid of those sores in your throat, then you might be able to get off PPI's down the line. When you do, please wean them off very, very, very slowly to minimize the rebound effect and all the other discomfort that comes along with the process.

Rose "}, "13": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi Tata: I am so sorry to hear you are going through so much pain and discomfort. I am fortunate that the worst I have experienced is moderate heartburn, nausea and indigestion here and there. Enough to make one's life miserable, but I have never had to go to the ER thinking I am having a heart attack. I can't imagine how frightening that must be. My symptoms clearly come from my gut and do not mimic anything else. I took Aciphex for nearly three years and it was very, very effective in cutting back reflux for me. I was completely or nearly completely asymptomatic. I decided to stop taking it two months ago for fear I would develop full blown osteoporosis. I am not sure everyone can go off PPI's and you may be one of those people who needs to keep taking the Aciphex. It is a blessing if it works for you and lets you lead a normal life, take care of your kids, etc. I am not even sure I'll be able to stay off it longterm. But I am going to try at least to stay Aciphex free for a few months to see if my current symptoms are related to acid rebound or they start to go away. I recently learned that acid rebound can last up to two months and even longer. Since you mentioned you have had a hysterectomy, make sure you up your calcium intake to 1200 mg a day and take vitamin D3 along with it for better absorption. My doctor recommended 1000 mg of vitamin D3 daily along with the calcium. She also told me to space the calcium intake through the day rather than take all four pills at once. I have recently found out that the best form of calcium is calcium citrate, as in Citracal, because calcium citrate can apparently be absorbed more easily by the stomach with or without much stomach acid. No doctor gave me this information when I started taking Aciphex at 52, also at the onset of my menopause. I wonder if I would now have osteopenia if I had been warned to take calcium and the right type of calcium. I now know all this information was out there in 2007. I have read old posts here that date back to 2003 or so. I want to make sure I am not encouraging anyone who should be on PPI's to get off PPI's. My decision to try to get off PPI's was a personal decision based on the discovery that I was losing too much calcium from my bones while on the Aciphex. I started to post here because I knew nothing about this process or PPI side effects or basically anything when I decided to run the experiment and see if I can taper off to a less potent antisecretory drug. I have been reading a lot and learning a lot through this board since the beginnig of January. I don't think I would have made it through week six off PPI's if I had not started to post here, received so much feedback, information and support. I am learning every day. Rose "}, "14": {"a": "9827", "t": "Something to check with your doctor, but my sense is that if you are on a PPI, your body has a tougher time getting the calcium it needs from pills and maybe even food. You may need to supplement with calcium citrate and vitamin D3, particularly if you are going to take the PPI long term. I also take a multivitamin, but (now) take 1200 mg of calcium citrate spaced into two doses, and 1000 mg of vitamin D3 which is the type of vitamin D3 the body absorbs and helps with calcium absorption. Again, check with your doctor, but it may be helpful for you to start supplementing now even if you are young because your bones are going to need to have a good supply of calcium later on. Rose "}, "15": {"a": "9827", "t": "I used to drink a lot of water when I was on Aciphex (still do, water is good for you), but often woke up dehydrated. I also used to be very constipated while on the Aciphex. So there must be something going on with PPI's that tends to dehydrate the body. I am now drinking the same amount of water and feel more hydrated, am more regular and don't have the dry mouth I used to. Antiviral medicines are very effective and, as far as I know, they are not a double edge sword like the PPIs. I hope they do start working for you very soon because I can't imagine having a sore, irritated throat for weeks. I am sure it hurts to swallow. You may end up not needing the PPI once the virus retreats. Rose "}, "16": {"a": "9827", "t": "Wish I could say I am still drinking coffee, hot or cold!

What I think is so interesting and puzzling about this process is how some remedies work for some people and not others. I have not found much luck with ginger, apple cider vinegar, apples, etc. However, others swear by them. Thank you for sharing. Rose "}, "17": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi TVC: I have noticed that I have to be careful when I take any supplements (vitamins, calcium, fish oil, etc) because they will irritate my stomach if I don't take them with actual solid food. I usually split my calcium supplements into two daily doses and I had been taking the morning one with yogurt. I noticed that I was developing stomach ache and some heartburn even though I was also taking an H2 blocker in the morning. Therefore, I have now switched that first dose to lunch or eat a bit more in the morning if I take my pills in the morning. I have not had heartburn if I take the vitamins with a heftier meal, i.e., lunch or dinner. So it is possible supplements may be irritating a stomach (or rather esophagus) that is already irritated by reflux. You mentioned your breakfast was bland. It may have not had enough substance in it or perhaps even a little fat to buffer those supplements. On a separate note, I have to tell you that I have good days and bad days that appear to have nothing to do with what I do or don't do or take or don't take. I practically eat the same thing every morning and lunch and I can have heartburn and discomfort some days and not others. It is frustrating for sure. I eat bananas, yougurt, cantaloupe, crackers, rice pudding, a small sandwich, almond milk, green tea with honey and that type of thing during my typical day. I eat throughout the day and eat small portions of the foods I mentioned. I also drink plenty of water, etc. I always worry about dinner time because that is when I have time to have my heaviest and heftiest meal (If I am going to have meat or something like that it will be in the evening) and I rarely get heartburn after dinner. I do eat early and don't eat large quantities of anything. That is what is so frustrating about this GERD business. I am also fortunate to not have reflux at night when I sleep. My stomach seems to go to sleep when I go to sleep. On another subject. This is the beginning of my seventh week off PPI's. I started this post a few weeks back when I decided to go off Aciphex. At first, I did not know what the heck I was doing or what to expect and, honestly, I did not think I could last two days off the Aciphex. I did not get much support from my family doctor who suggested I try Pepcid as a substitute, but said good luck and gave me another prescription for Aciphex anyway. I don't get severe hearburn every day now, but still have it every two to three days and probably have some mild heartburn, stomach pain and discomfort at least once a day. Chewing a lot of gum after dinner seems to help get that food down and digested, and the heartburn away. I recently decided to switch from Zantac 150 mg twice a day to Pepcid 10 mg twice per day. I have been told Pepcid is a newer H2 blocker and lasts a bit longer. I have been taking Pepcid for two days and, if it does not work better after a week or so, I may then go back to Zantac. I am trying to stay off the PPI. From what I have been reading, acid rebound from PPIs can last up to three months and longer. Gastrin levels (hormone that helps produce acid) apparently rise in the blood as a result of the acid suppression caused by the PPI use. Gastrin levels in one's blood then have to go down and level off upon PPI discontinuation, and then all those extra proton pump cells that were created by the excess Gastrin have to die off. Therefore, it is not a one to two week deal apparently. My sense is that one's stomach has to be sort of reprogrammed after the cessation of the PPI's, and that change may take a long time. We truly become dependent on those medications. I have been reading a lot on the subject and learning a lot even from finding medical journal abstracts online because I have not been able to get a straight answer from any of my doctors. Nobody really knows for sure and nobody was too supportive of my idea to go off the PPI. At this point, I don't know what part of my symptoms are due to PPI rebound and what part to the disorder (GERD) that led me to take PPI's in the first place. Unless I stick it out and stay off those PPI's longer, though, I am not going to ever find out. Therefore, I am still off PPI's, trying to be very disciplined with food, taking my supplements and now Pepcid and watching how things develop. TVC: I'll look into AbsorbAid to see if that is something that might help me. I started taking Align at another poster's suggestion and that seems to be helping with the gas and bloating, if not the heartburn. Thank you everyone for posting your experiences and suggestions. Rose "}, "18": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi Flyerfan: We have similar stories, except that I was on Aciphex for only three years. I thought Aciphex was a wonder drug. Once I was put on it, I could eat and drink anything and everything I wanted with no reflux or heartburn whatsoever. Aciphex was my best friend. As you have read through this thread, the reason I decided to get off Aciphex was my discovery that I had developed osteopenia (the precursor to osteoporosis) during the three years I had been on the Aciphex. I had a normal Dexa scan as a baseline the same year I began to take Aciphex. I am now 55 and my gynecologist suggested another one this past December. I was shocked when the scan came back showing advanced osteopenia on both hips. I must add I am in the midsts of menopause, but still having periods every two-three months. Therefore, my body is still producing estrogen and the consensus, even by all my doctors, was that the Aciphex was likely interfering with calcium absorption and the main cause from the change in the Dexa scans over a three year period. Much to my surprise, neither of my doctors suggested I get off Aciphex, but rather both independently suggested I get on Actonel, another type of drug I want to avoid at all costs. Biphosphonates are an entirely different story worthy of starting an entire new post. I have been off Aciphex now seven entire weeks. Had I not read about acid rebound (neither doctor told me either before I was put on the Aciphex or recently when I announced I wanted to get off). But, I was prepared for several weeks of misery. I have read rebound can last up to three months. I am currently taking 150 mg Zantac twice a day (morning and night). I recently started taking a regime of orange peel extract (D-Limonene extract) every other day for twenty days along with the DGL, digestive enzymes and probiotics. I am always reading to see what else I can find out there and the latest I read is that a low carbohydrate diet can significantly help to lessen acid production and reflux. Therefore, I began to slowly cut back on carbs over the past three days and must admit I feel better. I have had two-three decent days of being nearly symptom free. Tomorrow is the beginning of my eighth week off Aciphex. I hope I have begun to turn the corner and stop experiencing daily bouts of heartburn. The theory behind rebound is that the body produces excess gastrin (hormone) as a response to the PPI's. Once the PPI is removed, the gastrin signals the parietal cells in the stomach to start releasing acid and what we get is an acid storm that can last for weeks until gastrin levels normalize and we return to a baseline of symptoms (whatever you were experiencing when you were put on PPI's in the first place). From what I have read, you can supplement your PPI with an H2 blocker like Zantac during the withdrawal phase. I was able to cut my 20 mg tablet of Aciphex in half and took 10 mg for a few weeks before I finally went off it completely and began to take the Zantac. The first few weeks, as you have stated, were pretty horrible. Besides heartburn, I had stomach pains, horrible gas, pain in the pit of my stomach, you name it. I started this post to receive support from the forum, but also as a way to track my progress and, hopefully, so others like you can read about my journey and make the best decision for themselves. I think cutting down on carbs is helping me along with the orange peel extract capsules. Cutting down carbs is difficult as I soon realized I was eating a lot of carbs through yogurt, milk, potatoes and other foods I thought were good for my stomach because they were \"bland.\" Apparently carbs force the stomach to produce acid, and a diet low on carbs reduces stomach acid and reflux. I am not a scientist, but have already read about this from different sources and different internet sites. Apparently the acid produced as a response to ingesting protein is used to digest that protein and does not linger in the stomach. My suggestion to you if you want to try to get off Aciphex is to do so very gradually. I am not sure why you cannot cut your pills in half and gradually taper off. You'll probably have to go on an H2 blocker like Zantac or Pepcid as well as a low carbohydrate diet. Once you start to wean yourself off, then get set to likely experience weeks of discomfort. Besides the H2 blocker, I was supplementing with liquid Gaviscon, DGL, and chewing an awful lot of gum between meals. Somehow, chewing gum helped my digestion. I am not sure everyone is meant to be off PPI's and perhaps you need your Aciphex. Who knows whether I'll be able to stay off Aciphex long term. For sure, I am going to have to be more disciplined, stay off coffee, alcohol, all those starches, etc. I am being very, very careful right now and I am going to try to give the Aciphex a run for its money. I don't think my reflux will ever be \"cured.\" I have accepted it is a chronic condition and I'll probably have to take some type of medication my entire life. At this point, my goal is to try to use the H2 blockers rather than the PPI's. H2 blockers have not been associated in the literature with hip fractures or stomach tumors, likely because they are not as effective in blocking the production of stomach acid as the PPI's. It was the panic of fracturing a hip that led to my decision to try to get off and stay off Aciphex. I am not saying it is a \"bad\" drug. I am only saying it caused problems with calcium absorption for me, and I made the decision to get off it rather than add another type of drug (Actonel) that is associated with another host of bad side effects that, ironically, include heartburn. Good luck in your quest to get off Aciphex if you feel that is the right decision for you. Be prepared it will not be easy and arm yourself with all the information and support you can. Sadly, I have received no information and little support from my doctors. Neither doctor told me about the calcium malabsorption with PPI's or acid rebound. I have found all this information on my own. Rose "}, "19": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi Sharon: As far as the Aciphex, I don't know if they make more than one type of tablet. Mine were 20 mg, round and small, and I had no trouble cutting them in half with one of those pill guillotines you can buy at the pharmacy. I never knew they were enteric coated or that they could not be split (Then again, aspirin is enteric coated and I have to trouble splitting one in half and taking a half if I need to). The half dose (10 mg) worked very well. It was actually when I started to cut that half in half that I began to experience symptoms. I guess 5 mg is not enough to suppress acid. I actually told my family doctor that I was splitting the 20 mg pills in half and she said \"OK.\" Maybe she does not know any better. But split them I did, and they still seemed to work pretty well while I was using the halves (10 mg). The reason I refer to going back to a baseline is that I have been through seven weeks of pretty severe symptoms, but have begun to feel almost \"normal\" on the Zantac now that I am at the beginning of my eighth week off Aciphex. Before, I was feeling pretty crappy even on two 150 mg daily doses of Zantac. I don't take DGL all the time. I only take it when my throat feels raw, which has not occurred for three or four days. I don't find it very pleasant and it makes everything I eat taste like it. But there were a few weeks there when I was sucking on those pills three or four times per day. I was also taking teaspoons of honey to soothe my throat and esophagus and drinking the aloe juice. I have cut back on most of that by now that the Zantac and low carbs seem to finally be doing the trick. It is hard to remember to take all that stuff unless you feel miserable. I also had to be careful not to drink too much aloe juice as it gave me stomach cramps and diahrrea. A little aloe went a long ways for me. In my particular case, and assuming that my rebound symptoms have now begun to finally subside, it has taken almost two entire months for me to go for three entire days without experiencing heartburn or some other gastric symptom. I took my last Aciphex on January 20th or so. When I first got off the Aciphex, not only did I experience horrible heartburn, but I also began to experience symptoms I never had before the PPI's. These included: stomach pain, bloating, feeling of pain on the pit of my stomach, gas, and general indigestion. I have not experienced heartburn or indigestion for three entire glorious days, and I am being very careful to keep those carbs down and still stay off coffee, onions and other irritants. I love my coffee and love bread, rice, potatoes and all that good starchy stuff. But I'll stay away from them if I can manage my symptoms and stay off PPI's for good. If I can continue to maintain my present functioning and have decent days like the past few days, then I have finally begun to turn the corner. But I don't want to declare victory too soon. I think the low carbs are helping. I also think the orange peel extract is helping (or at least not hurting). I guess the trick is to keep that esophagus and throat coated and minimize the damage as much as possible as we are going through rebound. I took quite a bit of Gaviscon during the first couple of weeks. Rather than allow the heartburn to go on, I would take a tablespoon of liquid Gaviscon and start to feel better after ten minutes or so. I was very discouraged many, many days. There were days when I felt I was doing better, but others I felt I was going backwards. Three days forward, four days backward. I am going on spring break for a few days and hope I can hold on to my healthy diet and not give in to too much temptation. I am taking the DGL along just in case. Too bad I can't take a bottle of aloe juice on the plane. The one thing I would do differently if I had to do it all over again is to get off the Aciphex more slowly. I cut the pills in half for a week, then cut those halves in halves for a few days and, in about two weeks, I had stopped taking it completely and started the Zantac. I might do as you suggest to start alternating one day on Aciphex and the next on Zantac. Then, maybe one day of Aciphex, and two on Zantac and so on until you are taking more days of Zantac and less Aciphex. There has to be an easier way than the way I went about it. My goal at the beginning was to stay off Aciphex for at least three months to see if I could work through the rebound and get to a level where I could keep my symptoms manageable. Maybe I am there or maybe not. GERD is a fickle disorder. I'll report when I get back from spring break. Congratulations on your weight loss and hard work. I am sure they'll pay off health-wise. Rose "}, "20": {"a": "9827", "t": "Not bad. I was bad a couple of times and had a cup of decaf coffee and both times experienced heartburn. The rest of the time I may have felt slight heartburn after meals which I was able to fight off chewing gum and drinking a bit of water. I am still on my 150 Zantac twice per day and finishing up the D-Lemonene pills (every other day). I have cut down on the DGL a little bit and the Aloe, but I am trying to stick to my diet of low carbs and no offending foods as much as possible. I am definitely not in agony and have noticed that my days are no longer revolving around obsessing about rebound symptoms and whether or not I am going to experience heartburn after I eat. I think I can probably stay off the Aciphex if I eat carefully, avoid coffee (I am sad about that) and keep taking the Zantac. I may be able to eventually go to the 75 mg pill twice a day, but I don't think I'll ever be able to be medicine free again. I just hope I can avoid the PPI's. Their superior acid suppression is also what makes it harder for the stomach to absorb the calcium and such. Thank you for asking. It was not hard to keep to a low carb diet during the vacation. Fortunately, almost everyone sells a salad with chicken or a similar protein and I was able to keep the carbs to mostly mornings. Rose "}, "21": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi Jayner 1: Sorry for your trip to the ER and feeling your throat close in on you. I have a good friend who ate shrimp all her life and had a similar situation once. She ate shrimp at a restaurant, felt her throat closing, took some benadryl she had in her purse for allergies and drove herself to the hospital. Not sure why she did that, but she did. She arrived in the nick of time, was treated, given an EPY (sp?) pen, and told to avoid shrimp. She subsequently tried to eat a little bit of shrimp again to test the allergy and after a very small bite, started to feel her throat closing again. She gave herself the shot and vowed to never eat shrimp or shellfish again. Therefore, your throat closing may have nothing to do with the PPI or anxiety, expect that one's throat closing would certainly trigger an anxiety attack in me as well. I can't imagine the sensation of not being able to breathe. My only warning about PPI's, since you are starting or dealing with Menopause, is to have a Dexa scan to see how the PPI's may be affecting your bones, how much calcium you need, etc. Also, I was recently told by my doctor that it is a good thing to have one's levels of vitamin D checked to see if they are low. If so, we then need to take more vitamin D3 to assist with calcium absorption. I consider myself an informed person and didnot know any of this until recently. I feel like such a \"Duh\" for not knowing or checking. Even if you need to continue to take your PPI, there may be ways to prevent bone loss if you take more vitamin D3, calcium citrate (which is more easily absorbed even without stomach acid), etc. Hope you are feeling better soon. Rose "}, "22": {"a": "9827", "t": "It's weird how this process works. I have experienced quite a bit of heartburn tonight after dinner. I had a pretty decent dinner of baked fish with almonds (trout almondine) and carrots. No bread, no carbs, nothing fried and nothing but a little water to drink with dinner. Then, I came home and took my vitamins and whamo! I have experienced heartburn for close to three hours even after taking Gaviscon twice and sucking on two DGL tablets. All I can think of is that I took a bunch of vitamins after a fairly light supper and that may have irritated my stomach. I still hope I am turning the corner as you say but episodes like tonight are frustrating, particularly after I just posted here that I had done well for nearly my entire vacation. When this happens it makes me feel that this is a random process that has nothing to do with what I eat and not eat. Rationally, I know that is probably not true, but tonight I am feeling frustrated by the apparent setback. Rose "}, "23": {"a": "9827", "t": "Thanks for the good wishes. I finally ended up taking a third Zantac last night at about 1:30 in the morning (about six hours after the last one) when I realized the heartburn was just not going away. I took it again this morning, was fine this morning and up till lunch, then had some heartburn after lunch (not as bad as last night) and then nothing tonight, no heartburn after dinner. It is just as if my stomach had gone to rest or decided to give me a break tonight. I'll keep working on it. I am giving myself at least three months off PPI's before I make my decision to stay off them permanently or go back to them. But I need to give it a decent shot to see if I can work through the rebound and not experience heartburn almost daily. "}, "24": {"a": "9827", "t": "I seem to have one bad day, three good days and then another bad day. I had pretty bad heartburn last Monday afternoon-evening, then three fairly decent days and today, after following the same routine and taking the same medications/supplements, etc., I started having heartburn at around 10:00 A.M. and pretty much had it all day. I took DGL, drank lots of water and ate minimally and still had heartburn. I came home, took my evening Zantac and ate a dinner of chicken and vegetables. I am keeping my fingers crossed to see what happens once my stomach starts to empty. But it is very discouraging. I don't know if this is the way it will be from now on, and if I am through the acid rebound or not. I have now been about two months off PPI's. Just got through taking the 20 days of D-Limonene (orange peel extract) and I am still experiencing heartburn (on top of taking Zantac, DGL and everything else). So that did not work for me very well (sadly). Anyway, I will continue to post and report what is going on, what I am trying and if anything is working or not working. Today has not been a good day. I was stuck at work and could not run home to get antiacids or to the store to buy some. I pretty much had to suffer all day with this nonsense. It is discouraging because I am trying so hard to try all the different suggestions. Rose "}, "25": {"a": "9827", "t": "What remedies have you tried besides diet and elevating the bed?

I am now on H2 blockers and hoping to be able to someday be off medications and only on natural treatments for reflux. Rose "}, "26": {"a": "9827", "t": "In a way I consulted. I had been cutting down on the dose of Aciphex (from a whole pill to a half) between the discovery that I had developed Osteopenia (from a Dexa scan) during a visit to the Gyno doctor on December 22nd and my visit to the general practicioner January 24th. I explained to my family doctor then my intention to stop the Aciphex in efforts to slow down or stop the calcium malabsorption. She was not too enthusiastic but told me I could try Pepcid AC twice a day instead of the Aciphex. However, her recommendation to me was to stay on the Aciphex, take Actonel for the bone loss and then take even higher doses of Aciphex if the Actonel caused me any stomach trouble. I know that is the easiest way to do it, but I did not like the idea of taking Actonel (that's the subject of an entire new post) or having to then take even more Aciphex to counteract the Actonel. It seemed to me like creating a crazy, vicious cycle of more and more medicine to deal with a side effect originally created by the Aciphex. I took my last Aciphex on January 24th and have taken OTC Zantac from then on. But the general medical consensus from my two doctors is that I should stay on the Aciphex, take Actonel and then increase the Aciphex as needed to deal with the Actonel side effects (heartburn, etc). In other words, both of my doctors know but my sense is that they do not agree with my decision. The general practicioner mailed me new prescriptions for Aciphex and Actonel when she sent me the results of my lab work. Needless to say, I am currently taking neither. Rose "}, "27": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hang in there if you can. I am now a little over two months off PPI's and can say that I have barely begun to feel semi-normal. I was still experiencing pretty bad rebound by week five. Therefore, when gastroenterologists write that rebound can last up to three months, I believe it. You are probably going through the worst of it right now. Nobody ever told me about acid rebound or the dependency the PPI's can create. It just seems like such an easy medication to prescribe that I think doctors now have a tendency to overprescribe it without thinking too much about it. Then, we are stuck. I cut down my Zantac from 150 mg to 75 mg twice per day a couple of days ago to see if I can further wean myself off prescription medications. If I can hold it at 75 mg, I may stay there for a while with the blander diet, low carbs and other remedies I have been trying. But it has been a tough two months, that's for sure. Rose "}, "28": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi Co/1mm: Sorry you are going through a divorce. I know the stress and upheaval don't help the body heal. I am sure they keep your tummy churning. I had horrible rebound until about two weeks ago and I feel I may have just started to turn the corner and see a life without the darn PPI. I can't predict how it will go for you, but I think it can get better. If you are at week three, you are probably still in the thick of it. Hang in there if you can and feel you can play this out for a bit. What I did wrong when I started the weaning off process was to get off the PPI too quickly. I was off them a week when I started to experience the rebound. However, by then I was a week out and did not want to start the cycle all over again. That was the last week of January. This is what I have done to deal with this rebound phenomenon. All this may or may not work for you. 1) I took 150 Zantac twice a day until a couple of days ago when I reduced the dose to 75 mg Zantac twice a day. I'll see how it goes and will go back up to 150 mg if I feel I need the higher H2 blocker dose. I tried Pepcid too, but the Zantac worked better for me. 2) I found that a low carb diet has helped me. Try to reduce carbs as much as possible if you can and eat more lean protein, nuts and veggies (along with some fruit). For a while there, I was eating a lot of dairy, rice and potatoes and, tough bland, that type of diet was not helping me. For whatever reason, the stomach produces more acid to break down the carbs. 3) No coffee, alcohol and other acid producing foods. I think milk and dairy go into that category. I now drink almond milk and take my calcium citrate pills twice a day. I think decaf coffee has a lot of acid too. 4) Don't eat close to bedtime and don't go to bed with a full stomach. 5) I started drinking aloe juice but I now take aloe pills and slippery elm pills in-between meals. I also suck on DGL. I chew sugarless gum after meals for about an hour whether I have heartburn or not. I think it helps produce more saliva and aids with digestion. It is not hurting and I think it may be helping me. 6) I never take any pills, including vitamins, on an empty stomach. 7) Read all you can. Reading about acid rebound did not make the rebound any easier to deal with, but understanding the process better has helped me to make better decisions regarding whether or not to wait it out. If I had not come here and read old posts, I would have probably been back on the Aciphex within a week. Nobody can live through this rebound misery forever. On certain days I was experiencing heartburn for five or six hours non-stop. 8) I use liquid Gaviscon as a last resort when I experience heartburn, particularly if my stomach is bothering me before bedtime. I don't want to take too much because it has aluminum and a lot of aluminum is not good for you. But Gaviscon is a God-send when I am having one of my \"heartburn attacks\" that can last for hours. I think this has been it in a nutshell. I don't think PPI's are evil, but I am upset my doctors never informed me of side effects (possible osteopenia or osteoporosis, acid rebound, etc). I was simply told I had GERD, and would need to be on the PPI forever. Best wishes to you and please post and let us know how you are coming along. I have had some really bad days when I thought I had to take that PPI and here lately, I have begun to have more \"better\" or \"good\" days. I hope I can continue to stretch those out.

Not everyone is the same, but by week five you could still be experiencing rebound. I think the trick is that all those extra acid producing parietal cells in your stomach wall that your body created while the acid was being suppressed have to go through their cycle and die off. In the meantime, they are producing a lot of extra acid. When those extra cells die off and, assuming there isn't such strong acid suppression going on, then your body will not produce so many acid producing cells and the rebound should begin to level off. I know I am not explaining the process correctly, but that is what I read in a couple of journals. Are you taking any other medication to help you through the rebound? Any natural remedies?

Good luck to you and please keep us posted. I would love to hear how others are doing and if they have been successful and getting off PPI's. It is my intention to stay off PPI's, but my goal is to stay off at least three months and re-evaluate about my quality of life without them to see what the trade off is.

I don't know at this point how much of what I am experiencing is still rebound and how much is just my GERD. I have experienced nausea and heartburn today on and off on the same dose of Zantac (150 mg twice a day) after three or four pretty good days. I am like you. All the natural remedies seem to help a bit, but do not seem to have the same impact they do on others. I have tried aloe juice and capsules, orange peel extract capsules, cutting carbs, taking DGL, etc. with limited success. I read all the different posts about using probiotics and then feel frustrated when I am throwing everything and the kitchen sink at my heartburn and it seems to have a mind of its own. I now follow a pretty predictable diet of foods that typically do not produce reflux for me and I still have days of pronounced heartburn regardless of what I eat. I frankly still don't know if I'll be able to make the permanent switch to Zantac or I'll have to return to the PPI eventually. I don't mind followig a strict diet and I no longer drink coffee or alcohol and I still experience symptoms. Therefore, it is frustrating. I am on my second month off PPI's and I said I am going to give it three months before I decide whether I can stay off the medicine or will have to return to the PPI. My suggestion to you would be to cut off the coffee to see if that has any impact on your symptoms and start cutting back on the Omeprazole very slowly and gradually. Going cold turkey is probably going to be painful and not effective if in the end it forces you to go back on the PPI. I will keep posting here until I finish my three month experiment and make my decision to stay off the PPI or go back on it. I would like the other members who are struggling with this to know the eventual outcome of my situation. At this point, it appears that I can have two-three good days and one day of reflux and heartburn regardless of what I eat or don't eat and in spite of using Zantac. If that is the course of this disorder for me, I will then eventually have to decide whether I will continue to live with these symptoms or go back to the PPI. As you know from reading these posts is that what got me to quit the PPI was the discovery that I had developed osteopenia in both hips after two years of using Aciphex. The Aciphex worked great, only I did not know it was not allowing my body to absorb calcium. But please, do not go off Omeprazole cold turkey. I think that is the one mistake I made and others have also posted about that in here through the years.

The sad thing is that I am being very good about my diet trying to keep those carbs low and not eating offending foods. I am also religiously taking the DGL (which is why I may be nauseous rather than have horrible heartburn. It is probably coating and protectig my stomach a little bit). But this thing definitely has a mind of its own, and today I feel like it is defeating me (sigh).

I feel almost \"normal.\" But I have gone through several good days before only to then experience heartburn all of the sudden for no apparent reason. Too early to tell if the good trend will continue. From what I have read, acid rebound can take up to three months and sometimes longer for some people. I don't think everyone reacts the same, but I suspect that the rebound has something to do with how effective the PPI's are at acid suppression for the particular person. My sense is that the more effective the acid suppression the worse the rebound when the person goes off the PPI. In my case, the Aciphex worked like a charm. In fact, half a pill worked great! I used to cut the pills in half and take 10 instead of 20 mg. I must say the Aciphex was wonderful for me until I discovered I had developed osteopenia after using it for only three years! That got me going on this quest to see if I can get off and stay off the PPI. I don't know what other side effects I might develop if I take it for the next twenty years or so. I am only 55 and I hope to live to a ripe old age (longevity runs in my family). I am really afraid of developing osteoporosis and ending up with a fracture that might have been preventable. This is why I made the decison to stick with the three month commitment to not take PPI's even if the symptoms keep recurring. I would hate to give up at two months if I am almost there in terms of working through the rebound effect. I know I have GERD and I am probably going to have to be on some type of medication and restricted diet for the rest of my life if I want to stay off PPI's. But I have done my homework and feel I am taking a calculated risk. We'll see what happens. The reason I want to continue this thread until I make a decision one way or the other regarding PPI use is that I have read many posts here where people get off PPI's and one never knows whether they stayed off or gave up and went back on them after a few days or weeks of suffering. I suspect people post when they are in distress and then forget to come back to post or give up posting on their progress when they decide to go back to their old medication. Maybe in the future someone will read through this thread and it will help him/her make a more informed decison regarding whether it is worth it for them to try to wean off PPI's or it is a futile attempt.

Now, I seem to just be back to the same old heartburn that got me on the PPI in the first place, but all the other weird symptoms have sort of resolved. Maybe five weeks off a PPI is not long enough to figure out what is PPI withdrawal and what are one's own symptoms. Unfortunately, neither of my doctors has been much help in this regard. Rose "}, "39": {"a": "9827", "t": "[QUOTE=LMF123;4226248]Hi everyone, Well I tried something different for me this morning. I am at 3 1/2 weeks off Nexium and have been treating with Tums/Gaviscon and occassionally Zantac. When the heartburn hits, it is absolutely dreadful. Pain in my esophagus and awful burning. I can see how people just go back on the PPI's because if I had to live this way indefinately, I would be miserable. This morning I took a Zantac 150mg on an empty stomach. So far so good. Perhaps I need to do that until things settle down. There are so many unknowns, it just seems like a game we are guessing at what is the right and wrong thing to do. I do know that I had considerable physical side effects and I have to find a way to stay off the PPI's. Hi LMF: I am so glad you brought up the point about taking Zantac on an empty stomach. I meant to post about this, but I had completely forgotten about it it until you mentioned it in this post. When I take the Zantac first thing in the morning with water and wait thirty or so minutes before I eat anything else, the Zantac seems to be absorbed and work better all day. When I am in a rush and take the Zantac along with all my other vitamins and breakfast, it seems to either not work or not work as well. It took me a while to figure this out but I have seen a definite pattern. I now take Zantac with water first thing in the morning, take my shower and when I get out of the shower and dry my hair, then I go and take my vitamins with almond milk and whole grain toast. That seems to work reasonably well or work perhaps ninety percent of the time. I now have to go back and pay closer attention to see if any future \"bad\" days correlate with a day when I was in a rush and could not give the Zantac the chance to be absorbed by my stomach before I took a bunch of other competing stuff along with it. Maybe this information will help others who are also using the H2 blockers instead of the PPI. When I took Aciphex, I could take it any time, with or without food. Before that, when I took Zegerid, I had to take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and wait thirty minutes before I could eat anything else. I don't know if others see a correlation between how they take their medicine and its effect. I am still hanging in there. I had another decent day today. I did not notice any heartburn all day and did not find myself thinking about it either, which is a nice break. I could not have stayed off the Aciphex without some other type of medication to ease the rebound. The heartburn was so bad the first two-three weeks that I would have gone back running to the Aciphex. It was worse than anything I experienced before I began to take the PPI. This is why I am now trying so hard to stay off the Aciphex and continue taking milder/older medications like Zantac. Rose "}, "40": {"a": "9827", "t": "My understanding is that prescription Zantac comes in either 150 mg or 300 mg doses. One of the OTC Zantac is now 150 mg. That is what I take. I am not sure there is much more of a difference beyond that. I am prone to develop headaches and I think both the Aciphex and Zantac probably contribute to them. Zantac has been around for a long, long time (over twenty five years) and I have not read of serious side effects like the increase in stomach tumors and hip fractures that you read about in some studies on PPI use. However, I am sure all medicines have side effects. I make sure to take Zantac on an empty stomach and wait thirty minutes before I eat or drink anything else. I want to give it a chance for my body to absorb the medication. I have found Zantac a bit constipating. But it is a histamine blocker and I get the same effect from Benadryl which is a different type of histamine blocker. I drink prune juice and take fiber tablets almost daily which help for that. Not too glamorous but it works and keeps me from using laxatives which is not a good thing to use regularly. I am sure I will follow up with a gastro doctor sometime in the future and probably have another endoscopy. But I would have done that even if I had stayed on the Aciphex. I think those of us who suffer from these symptoms should probably be scoped once every five years even in the absence of symptoms. You can have damage and not feel heartburn. Rose "}, "41": {"a": "9827", "t": "Marigold: I would love to read more on what your naturopath is telling you and the reasons behind the treatment he or she is prescribing. The idea of eating pureed food when the stomach is irritated makes good sense to me. It gives your gut a chance to rest. My acid rebound coming off Aciphex was horrible and I think it has lasted nearly three months. I feel like I am just now beginning to have more \"normal\" days on the Zantac. The first month off PPI's, not only did I have horrible attacks of heartburn, but I also had bloating, pain and many other symptoms I had never suffered from before. Anything I ate gave me heartburn. I think even pureed food would have given me heartburn. I immediately cut out the main offenders such as coffee, alcohol, etc. but even then I would have days of constant heartburn and throat irritation. I had to do some digging to come up with literature on rebound and finally found some journal article somewhere that stated it could last three or more months. I am glad I read that or I would have run back to the PPI after two weeks of misery. What makes me really angry is that I was on an H2 blocker and not doing badly three years ago when I went to the GI doctor to see why I could not get rid of the heartburn and find out whether something else was wrong. The PPI's were pushed on me as \"far superior\" and guaranteed to make me feel better. Nobody told me about side effects and I failed to do my research back then. I am very health conscious. I don't smoke or drink alcohol in excess. I am not overweight at 125 lbs. I exercise. I still ended with this darn GERD and now have osteopenia to boot due to PPI use for only three years! I may have to do some research on naturopathic medicine to see if I can find books to read and see what their philosophy is in this area. I feel modern traditional medicine has failed me on this GERD/PPI deal. Rose "}, "42": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi Jayner. Zantac is definitely more \"binding\" for me if I understand your question correctly. Not sure what its PH is. But that is a good question since we are supposed to be taking in more \"alkaline\" foods and stuff if we have these GERD issues going on. But I would love to hear more information if anyone has it. Maybe there is a pharmacist out there reading this who can answer the question. "}, "43": {"a": "9827", "t": "Well, I may be beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel with respect to the acid rebound. Today is April 19 and I am a few days short of the third month anniversary of the day I stopped taking Aciphex. I have been nearly one hundred percent heartburn free for a week and only taking the Zantac twice per day. I have not had to take antiacids, chew gum or take a lot of DGL. I hate to jinx myself but I feel almost normal. Maybe I am on the other side of the rebound. I can see myself now staying on the Zantac until I can begin to decrease the dose from 150 mg to 75 mg. I hope I continue on this course and can be a success story. I guess the moral of the story is that it can take up to three months for one's body to get used to being without the PPI and for blood levels of gastrin to go back down to normal. Rose "}, "44": {"a": "9827", "t": "Hi LMF: At week four, I think it is safe to say that you are still going to experience quite a bit of burning. At week four and much later, I was still having three decent days followed by two pretty rotten days. Those were the days when I took a lot of DGL to soothe my throat and esophagus. I would also take Gaviscon after dinner which I have now not taken for over three weeks. That Gaviscon was a lifesaver. Not the best thing to take long term because it contains aluminum, but great for short term use. You may want to try it and see if it works for you. Everyone has their little remedies that they swear by. I think mine is going to be coconut water or coconut juice (the unsweetened kind). I have been sipping it during the day. Today, I experienced a little bit of heartburn after dinner and I began to sip the coconut juice and it is now gone! It's amazing how we all have different remedies that help us. Apple cider vinegar and ginger give me terrible heartburn and yet they are touted as heartburn remedies by many. I am still on the Zantac twice a day. I take it on an empty stomach thirty minutes before breakfast and dinner. I have tried to take Pepcid twice and, for whatever reason, it does not seem to work as well for me as the Zantac. I ate a bit more carbohydrates today than usual and that might be why I am experiencing a bit of heartburn tonight. I am reading more about low carb diets to see how safe it is to be in one and how low on carbs one can safely go without risking one's health. I absolutely love coffee and really miss it. I am going to research to see if there is such as thing as \"acid free\" coffee out there. I know it is not the lack of caffeine but the acid in the coffee that is tough on the tummy. Coffee was my only vice before this thing started. Even on Aciphex, I could drink as much coffee as I wanted without any heartburn. I still have a few sips of coffee here and there when I go out to eat and my stomach is full with dinner. Then I feel I can cheat a little bit, but I would not dare have a cup of coffee on an empty stomach right now as I used to. My throat definitely burns when I have heartburn. I take slippery elm lozenges that you can buy online. Singers use them and they are soothing to the throat. They are supposed to be natural and safe. I also take a tablespoon of honey when my throat burns and let it slowly slip down my throat. These are the little tricks I have tried to ease the discomfort and try to protect my tissues from damage by the acid. Anyway, hang in there. I think there is light at the end of the tunnel. Please keep posting. Maybe all these posts will inspire and support future forum readers who are going through this same process in the future.

Mm...not all the time but as you say they occur in episodes. Very uncomfortable and annoying when they do appear though. I started to suffer terrible GERD and IBS at the same time 2 months ago following 5 courses of antibiotics (!!!! no wonder huh?) . My symptoms were so severe and honestly it felt like dying. The breathlessness was just dreadful on top of so many other symptoms. That chapter is still continuing and I'm on medication to try and settle things down. Feels much better compared with what it used to be but still the stomach is highly sensitive to certain things...like heavy meals, chili, strong spices. So, I'm careful to avoid them but yesterday was bad judgement. It was rice and only after eating can you really judge how heavy it is on the stomach. So, that was a big mistake.

Still more to cut down but watching the symptoms again before taking another step.

Has anyone found a relationship between Nexium and the digestion? Something I wonder is whether the lack of acid is contributing to my issues with digestion at times. Say for example, if you end up having a meal that is a little harder to breakdown (hence we call it 'heavy'), that breaking down process to the best of my understanding has a lot to do with the acid. So, in theory, if there is enough acid, then logically, the meal should not be found 'heavy' to digest. When Nexium stops the acid this makes even normal meals become 'heavier' on the stomach I feel when thinking along these lines. That means the stomach will struggle and perhaps the extra stain may cause spasms? So, in a way, this Nexium I am taking might be preventing me from achieving 'normal' digestion...hence, the stomach might be OK as it is, but when I eat something even a little heavy, it becomes upset again because it finds it hard to digest. This may leads to these tremors, bloating etc? So, in theory LACK of acid caused by Nexium might be a cause behind the tremors?

My tremors are like....well, you know how when we burp the \"grrrrrr\" sound comes sometimes and with that brings an internal vibration sort of feeling. Like the esophagus is momentarily shaking up like feeling...well, the stomach is like that. Makes noise sometimes but that is minimal. When I say stomach it feels like the middle part near the belly. Feels like some earthquake tremor going on in there and with the beating of the heart combined with that, good luck sleeping ;-) Since taking this medication I've noticed that my heart is more 'felt'. Usually unless you focus on it, you don't feel its there right...but, this is no longer the case. The stomach also does jazz to a cracked up rhythm now ;-) No cramps. No pain. Just feels like tremors. I am also suspicious that this Nexium is causing it. \"Internal Tremors\" is apparently a side effect. I also feel minor tremors in my hands sometimes....this was highlighted by another helpful comment which pointed out 'magnesium deficiency' (Nexium makes the body unable to absorb with calcium and magnesium). But those tremors are more 'rare'. The stomach ones are far more frequent. Sometimes they go down and I cannot feel them but they surely return. Particularly close to a bowel movement, I feel these strongly. Also a certain weakness comes through the body. They do get relieved after I go. IBS? Gastritis? I have both so maybe both AND the drugs? .... What a mess isn't it.....it is depressing to think about and also go through this day after day. The tremors by the way started recently (they had stopped for a few weeks). This got triggered after I had that 'heavy' meal. That night I couldn't even sleep well. Yesterday I slept much much better. Tremor was very lightly there but not enough to keep me awake. I have noticed that if I eat, fall asleep for say 10 mins and suddenly get up, the whole system shakes badly. Then after a few minutes it settles back to 'normal' tremors that are much milder. I have bloating. Mainly on the upper stomach. Lower stomach also gets bloated sometimes. I do get the 'acid' like feeling now and then and a funny taste in my mouth (like metal. .) . I either eat something or take an anti acid when this happens and it goes away. Occasional chest pain comes, mild but the moment you do the anti acid or eating something it subsides. Heaviness in the chest is more or less the same though harder to be rid of, occurs not so frequently.

Typically with GERD, acid will cause areas in the esophagus and throat to become inflamed and irritated (which causes hoarseness and a sore throat). Your body's reaction is to create more mucus to try and protect those areas, which is why people with GERD complain of chronic throat clearing. In some cases, the irritation is severe enough to cause inflammation in the sinuses, which causes additional post-nasal-drip, and you've got a vicious cycle on your hands. In those cases it generally takes 8-12 weeks of treatment with PPIs like omeprazole, plus lifestyle changes to give those irritated areas a chance to heal and for things to return to normal. If the ENT is unsure, and there are minimal signs of infection, there is no reason to even consider sinus surgery at this point. Your best bet would be to keep using the butacort, start irrigating your sinuses daily with a neti pot or SinusRinse bottle, and work with your GP to really try to eliminate the possibility that acid reflux is the underlying cause of your symptoms (12 weeks of at least 40 mg omeprazole daily plus the appropriate lifestyle changes). You might also stick with the allergy treatment - it could be one more thing that is playing a part in all of this.

Anyway, just some venting... "}, "5": {"a": "29135", "t": "Update: First of all, a big knock on wood here. Anyway, have been about 3-4 days with a significant reduction in my horrible burping problem. The only thing that I changed? Stopped taking my daily Prilosec. About a week ago, I saw a gastroenterologist, and he said I was just swallowing air, and that I was burping because of anxiety (actually what I thought he would say). It's pretty frustrating when doctors just want to peg something that they have no clue of on anxiety...I guess it's just an easy out. Thing is, that if he or anyone else had the same bloated feelings and feelings of air trapped in their chest/esophagus, they would also be burping nearly non-stop. He even had the nerve to tell me that the Gas-X and Charcoal Pills I was taking that sometimes made me feel better, were working because they were a placebo to me. So, I was actually lucky to get an Upper GI the very next day, and it wasn't that bad. They said I have a hiatal hernia, and that my constant burping was causing my stomach to lift into my esophagus, and thus corroding it, allowing for reflux, which actually isn't even the problem, and is very tolerable by myself. He, as expected, told me to continue with the Prilosec and to get anti-anxiety meds from my GP. It's funny, because the first time I had this problem, my burping problems stopped when I stopped taking the prilosec. Here we are again, and the only difference in my lifestyle was/is that I stopped with the prilosec. I'm not an MD, but I would venture to guess that perhaps the Prilosec was causing too little acid to be in my stomach, and because of that, foods were not being digested properly, and were rotting/fermenting, causing gas and then the constant burping. Anyway, this is just an update and not a resolution/conclusion. I simply experienced a significant decrease in a major problem, and attributed it to the only change that I had for myself. I'm sure I have a long way to go, but will keep everyone updated, good or bad. "}, "6": {"a": "29135", "t": "Hello, Sorry for the delay. I had to think about your question for a while. I've been off of all PPI's for about a month, I believe. Experienced some rebound extreme acid, and then not too much after that (the times when I did have acid, I could easily control it with a Pepcid AC). My burping stopped for about 3-4 days after I stopped with the Prilosec, and then kind came back to a lesser extent after that (much less severe than before). Even though my Gastro and most others were and are so convinced that the only reason for my burping was because of my nasal problems/occassional mouth breathing and anxiety, they will never give you an explanation as to why I or anyone else who have these symptoms never had them before. Also, a lot of people breath through their mouth and have anxiety, but I would doubt that many of them have belching as a problem. Anyway, I've found that the most important thing you can do is to make sure your diet is good. Eat smaller meals and more frequent meals; Make sure you completely cut out problem foods/drinks. Coffee is done for me. You wouldn't think tea would be bad, but it is and was, in fact, one of the worst things for me, as far as burping. Next is you need to have the right medicine on hand. If you are having bad acid reflux/burning, you need to control it with a Pepcid AC or other drug first. You can try the charcoal caps, but I'm not super crazy about them. Try popping 2-3 Simethicone/Gas-X pills, and see how that helps. I also found out something interesting when I had my Upper GI Endoscopy. They had me laying down, and I was a little gaseous, burping and uncomfortable - A lot because the position was conducive to this. After they sprayed that gross anesthetic spray in my throat, my burping/uncomfortable feeling actually was greatly reduced. Because of this, sometimes when I have a mild burping feeling, I will suck on a cough drop for a few minutes. The cough drop is a mild anesthetic, and when the material gets in your throat/esophagus, It can sometimes reduce your need to burp. Those are just my thoughts for right now. Nowhere near beating this thing, but at least it's a little bit better and I'm better at managing it when I do have it.

Back to the burping, I honestly feel that you just have to try to manage it. Don't bother wasting your time with doctors on this - They will never help you out, and will just attribute the burping to GERD and/or anxiety, and prescribe you that PPI garbage.

The 100 or 150 mg capsels have been ordered to the clinic on the grounds where I am staying. Apparently, for 2 patients out of 10 in David Sycamore's study, higher doses were needed after a week or two to start seeing results. The German doctor also wants to suprisingly quickly get me to high doses so he can personally see if it has results. He first offered me neurontin, but I turned it down for lyrica. Neurontin is next though, and elavil then, and whatever else. Today I ate a donair again. Then later ate something that just looked like a pile of deep fried cheese and fries. I then drank two beers. I have noticed a slight improvement in my LPR symptoms. I'm not being sarcastic, but anyway, these diseases or symptoms or whatever we all have are mysterious indeed, and I guess doctors need to deal with them on a case by case basis, and that partly explains why people like us don't get effective treatment yet.

For 10 years or more I ate chicken wings, beer, whatever I wanted, smoked on and off, and despite all that had no GERD or anything. It was like a diet to create heartburn and I didn't have it. This September I got really worn down with stress, and then went exhausted to Germany on Sept 28. Nothing was wrong, but I wasn't eating when I got here for the first few days, and just burning the candle at both ends. I just got nailed by this cold (Europe is crowded and there are a lot of weird germs in the fall) by about October 1st or so. I just couldn't believe how much snot was coming out of my nose, and I was coughing, even coughing up blood, I was pretty dizzy. It was just the mother of all colds. Suddenly, after about a week, 1 day, it was just like my larynx exploded with globus and painful unsatisfying swallowing. At the same time, I had a burning, tingling numb tongue, almost like an allergy, suddenly for about 30 minutes. That went away, but the other symptoms stayed and were joined by throat clearing which I think may have actually started in earnest with my first ppi. The throat clearing is minor though. I could live with that. The problem is, it almost feels like nerves are going off at the left side of my throat ever since, and basically they create an imaginary object there. I still had a cold when I went to the first ENT and he saw a red pharynx and put me on ppis. They did nothing or maybe made it worse. I tried every combination for 5 weeks or so and just got off of them. Since just going back and eating what I want and just living a normal lifestyle, it seems like all the symptoms basically keep decreasing in severity. Today was a good enough day that I almost felt weird about getting the pregabalin. But anyway, it still feels weird and oversensitive in my throat, despite the fact that the last ENT, a week ago, said \"there is absolutely not one sign of damage in the larynx or throat.\" So basically he said he didn't know how to help me and sent me to the neurologist. It seems weird that a guy who eats like that and has no reflux, even on an endoscopy, would have reflux, when the only symptoms are in his throat and appeared immediately and simultaneiously, with a tingling tongue, in the throes of a really bad cold virus, with a very low immune system.

I think it has a few other positive effects like that, that could be good for people with any version of LPR. Just like people say valium and xanex often help their LPR, but they always worry about the addictive side of those understandably. In Lyrica's case, it's not very addictive at all, which is one of its major advantages. It is also difficult to build up a tolerance to it. People can go on the same dose for 7 years or so without any need to raise the dose, in my own personal viewings, and the drug has only been available that long. Anything that can give people with fibro myalgia their lives back is a pretty good drug. A lot of people go on boards to whine when a drug doesn't work and they don't say anything if it does work, so you'll see a lot of garbage that might make it sound like a bad idea.

So I'm still on the road to recovery. I would recommend you take lyrica or neurontin to try. It is way more likely to help you than ppis. However, if you want to try the big guns, go for amiltryptiline (elavil) or klonopin. It seems like those get bigger results with much less of a dose, but they can also have side-effects. Keep in mind the side-effects are a lot better than the current symptoms you have. And remember. If they work for you, post it. By the way, check out on the internet \"Peak Woo\" and \"David Sycamore MD\" These are the guys who sort of lead the way in understanding that throat symptoms that begin with a URI can be relieved, strange as it sounds, but anti-siezure and anti-depression medicines.

Like you I had no pre-exisiting reflux condition and believe my horrendous reflux is due to coming off PPIs. The doctors just want to increase the medication, but I know that is not the answer. From my experience the body attempts to rebalance and in doing so swings between high gastrin and high acid secretion, which in turn leads to lower gastrin and lower acid output which then triggers more gastrin and more acid and so on, which explains the reason for good days and bad days. For me, I don't think it is triggered by certain foods, but I avoid all known triggers and eat bland safe foods: Soft cooked vegetables, basmati rice, bananas, papaya etc. I avoid any 'rough' foods as these may not trigger acid but can scratch the oesophagus and then the acid will kill when it burns the damaged area (which normally heals without being noticed). Like you water also stings. I find drinking wam water is ok. There are various natural remedies and as others have said you need to find what works for you. Anything like vinegar or lemons are alkalising but disastrous if the oesophagus is burnt. The most beneficial thing has been drinking Japanese Kukicha tea. It is soothing and alkalising and does not burn - don't drink it whilst boiling hot obviously. Also coconut water - fresh from a coconut so that citric acid has not been added.

It is rich in healing minerals. As for how long the rebound lasts I don't know as I'm still going through it, but I was on 20mg for 8 months and then 40mg for 2 months. It took about 5 months of agonising pain before it started to balance out... now I am on 20mg and reducing slowly, but not without any symptoms.

Patti "}, "1": {"a": "23005", "t": "Hi Never I was on double dose PPI (pantaprozole) for 3 months which is the recommended period in the UK to measure its effectiveness. With regard to the PND I believe that what the article was saying was that where there are no other serious sinus or nasal cavity infections or problems present then any excess mucous from the nasal cavity must be caused by LPR. My ENT found no sinusitus, polyps or other problems other than either nostril can be blocked at any given point of the day. I do not experience sinus headaches which I understand you would know when you have one. When one nostril gets blocked regularly throughout the day you may not notice this as the other is functioning ok. I do not recall having any blocked nostrils prior to on set of the globus and mucous symptoms. From a rather more personal perspective I also hardly ever have to clear my nose of snot which in the past I would have done regularly in common with everyone else. Not sure about this connection but to me it seems related to blocked nostril effect and the mucous. I have tried the Grossan Irrigator but it was sometimes painful to use which Dr Grossan suggests is an indication that there is no significant sinus problem. So if you do not suffer from recurrent blocked nostrils and have to clean your nose regurlarly then perhaps the reflux is not reaching your nasal passage. Alternatively the mucous could be the normal thin nasal discharge that everyone has which on its journey down your throat gets intercepted by the pooling acid and bile from the reflux,goes no further and thickens accordingly. From my understanding the stomach reflux itself is thin and is not accompanied by any mucous. I have an Upper GI (endoscopy) on 4/28/05 which I am hoping will shed some light. I suspect that it will pick up some or all of the following: hiatus hernia, loose Lower Espohgael Sphincter and loose Upper Espohgael Sphincter. I will post its findings. As for answers - research studies into the effectiveness of Fundo surgery are just beginning but early indications show that for 90% of sufferers it cures or significantly reduces the reflux and it ssymptoms with no need for continued expensive meds. Never, do you have any other symptoms apart from the globus and throat clearing ? Do you experience as I do an acidic taste in your mouth, mouth burning,tongue coating and BB. Hope helps..........brevity is not my strong point...sorry. "}, "2": {"a": "23005", "t": "Hi Never, As regards the PND and the pooling with the reflux that I must admit is my take on it. However, it does make sense. I am a little unclear on it still. All I know is that when I look look to the farthest back of my throat I will see the mucous sticking to the throat tissue. It appears as if it is sliding down very very slowly but that could be my imagination. I don't think I experience any sensation of it coming from the nasal cavity. I do not think that it is our normal saliva mixing with the reflux unless the reflux itself acts as some kind of thickening agent. Normal saliva will be thin and relatively clear and when spat out would run down the plug hole without any need to turn the fawcett on. Mine would stay there for ever if I did not wash it away. On particularly bad days I could clear my throat almost constantly. However, your doc may be right about the swollen tissue being the cause of the globus because on better days I could have relatively little throat clearing but the globus would still be present. In the 8 months I have had these symptoms there was only 3 separate 3 day periods where I in my opinion I had no symptoms at all. No globus, no mucous, little white coating on tongue and no BB. On the first occasion I got relief whilst I was taking Zantac for a few days. Totally inexplicable since the PPI didn't do it. The second time was around Xmas. I ate, drank and was merry with no effects and finally a couple of weeks ago after my tonsillectomy after using Flagyl syrup meds for a few days. I suppose my symptoms are as follows : Globus : Almost always present. Strongly just now. Not present when waking but appears soon after. Excess Mucous : worse at other times but never too far away. Burning/tingling sensation in mouth : present when BB at worst. I think this might the acid. Feeling of food getting stuck : Certainly any pill I take will not go down first time and recently it feels like very small particles of food are getting caught somewhere because I see and smell them in the mucous. White tongue coating/ BB : For me this is by far the worst symptom and one which has had the greatest effect on me. The mucous and globus I could stand as a mild irration though I know the damage from the reflux might be doing far worse. But it is the BB that makes me determined to get to the bottom of what is wrong. I never had it until these other symptoms appeared. Stinging sensation in nasal cavity : Occasional. less so now but again could be the effects of the acid reaching that area. The tonsil stones and their distinctive odor have gone since the operation but their source still exists .....the mucous and the acid. I have not taken any form of acid suppresant for 6 months and have just lived with it. I will be interested to see the outcome of the Upper GI as I kind of suspect and hope in a way some form of hiatus hernia or loose sphincter as the cause of the reflux. This would explain the ineffectiveness of the PPI. Any others out there experiencing this ? "}, "3": {"a": "23005", "t": "Hi Sartor, Sorry to hear you are a fellow sufferer. You are right the NHS is shocking. My GP wasn't interested and it is only through my own time and money that I have got anywhere at all. Be persistant and prepared to part with cash for private consultations. Your symptoms are kind of similar as regards the BB. However, you do not mention having a globus sensation, excess mucous and throat clearing although if you have PND then perhaps the last two are present. The acidic bitter taste in your mouth and back of throat is consistent with LPR but my understanding is that a serious globus sensation should also be present to indicate LPR. In relation to GERD the ENT initially asks the patient about instances of heartburn but in relation to LPR he would look at your throat for visual evidence of redness and/or tissue damage to the pharynx and larynx. If he did not see this it could be that there is no reflux this far up. On the other hand it might not as yet have managed to inflict significant visible damage and this could explain the lack of globus which is an indication of tissue inflammation. The acid could however have significantly upset the balance in your oral flora creating an acidic and anaerobic enviroment. It is called silent reflux for good reason in that the symptoms may start presenting after some damage is done. I do not have any chronic nasal condition ....least not what I have been told ...and certainly no infected discharge. I do have blocked nostrils and a stinging sensation as if the nasal tissue is being irritated by something. I think this is the acid reflux which I think has also caused damage to cillia movement hence the PND. I too suffered from tonsil stones and my ENT thought they were formed as a direct result of the reflux. PND and tonsil stones go hand in hand but whether your disharge is down to sinusitus or reflux I am not sure. He was keen for me to resolve this issue first but I was determined to have a tonsillectomy as the stones were a nightmare and made by BB beyond belief. Your papillae will hold on to the stones and the crypt discharge and you may see a white coating on the heads. The odor from the stones is very fetid both mouth and nose and different from traditional BB and perhaps this is what your family are commenting on. The tonsillectomy (private ...6 months waiting list on NHS) has got rid of the stones and their odor but I still have the mucous, the globus, burning mouth and a more traditional BB. Perhaps the removal of the cryptic tonsils will be the answer for you as many people get BB relief when this is the cause. For me the stones where a by product of another process but still well worth being shot of. Hope this helps. "}, "4": {"a": "23005", "t": "Hi Matt, Welcome to the thread. I too had my tonsils removed a few weeks ago so sympathies there. However, I had the symptoms you talk about prior to the tonsillectomy and still continue afterwards. I have probable LPR. My ENT was convinced that my tonsil stones (or blobs) were caused by the reflux but I believe only in so far as it created a food source for them in the form of the excess mucous. I am still glad they're gone and touch wood the distinctinve tonsil odor has gone and hopefully the stones.....but I still have BB. Your symptoms are conceivably LPR but I would have thought your ENT would have seen some visual evidence of tissue damage or inflammation aside from the trauma of your surgery. That being said the excess mucous, constant throat clearing and acidic taste are clear indicators of LPR. Do you have a globus sensation of something being semi-permanently stuck in your throat as this is regarded as the most prevalent symptom ? . As regards you still having stones I know it is not unheard of for them still to form in smaller sizes in pockets in the throat which are usually caused by reflux damage. However, I wonder if what you are actually seeing is very small pieces of regurgitated or undigested food. I am experiencing this since the tonsillectomy and are seemingly related to the reflux. If they do not have that distinctive tonsil odor it is unlikely that this is what they are. As for your BB. Is it still as bad as when you had the tonsils or has it lessened ? Do you get a white tongue coating regularly ? If you are interested there is a really helpful, supportive and informative thread on BB and personality. You maybe interested to give your direct BB experiences there. Hope this helps Message for Sartor How are things going "}, "5": {"a": "23005", "t": "Hi Sartor, There was a 6 month wait on my local NHS. The operation was done in the private part of the Staffordshire General (miles from me in Kent) but this was the cheapest I could find. It cost a total of \u00a3 1300. Post operative care is zero what with the distance involved ....any bleeding you go to your GP. The first week post op was probably the worst odor I experienced but this was clearly an anaerobic infection which cleared up with Flagyl syrup. When they cut through the tissue depending on how deep the crypts are the contents are released and unfortunately you can be coughing them up for the first week along with any stitches. My surgeon said that one of them (the right one) was chronically infected and a factory for stones. I suppose if that is your only breath problem as I said then it should work. But if like me you suspect the stones are a by -product of some other process then the improvement may vary. I feel it was worth it as I no longer have stones or their taste or odor (which is by the far the worst BB...... smells like ******). I know the taste is not there because it used to provide distinctive saliva on chewing gum. I don't get that now. Also I would smell the stone odor myself sitting down or in the car. People's reactions were also a sign. A good way of testing the breath impact is to blow hard and then sniff....tonsil odor is strong and fecal. I don't get that now. I am now getting a more traditional BB similar to morning breath but at various points of the day dependant upon excess mucous levels, globus, tongue coating (all LPR related ?) and stress. So far touch wood no stones of any size from any other crypt. I know that diverticulums or pouches in the pharynx and larynx can be caused by LPR. I have been post op experiencing regurgitated or undigested small food bolus which I think is reflux related. I am 40 this year and my symptoms started almost a year ago eg globus, mucous, bitter taste and BB. Around this time I was planning on moving to Scotland which in hindsight was very stressful. I already had a peptic ulcer, overweight, fairly bad diet and oridinary dental regime. So it's not a surprise really. That's why I know it is LPR and not Gerd because I have no heartburn or ulcer pain. If my stomach was producing too much acid my ulcer would be telling me. I take no medication. PPI's didn't work and I do not need the Cimetidine for the ulcer as it gives me no problem. I have an endoscopy on Thursday so I will fill you in with the results of that. On the BB thread I raised the possible reason as being our inability to produce sufficient quantities of the right kind of saliva. The thread seems to be taking the view that our mouths are alkanline and need to be more acidic but I dont think that adds up. I am going to test my saliva PH over a period of time (a week) and compare it with my partners who has no BB problem. I think it will show that my mouth and saliva is overly acidic and therefore without oxygen and that hers is within the range of neutrality. Will be interesting to find out. Perhaps you could take part. "}, "6": {"a": "23005", "t": "Note to Bserchuk I am in the UK but I did come across some research on LPR on the net from the New York Hospital - Cornell Medical Center. Their specialist is Jerry Huo MD on 212-746-2270. Hope the number makes sense. "}, "7": {"a": "23005", "t": "Sartor, I am not sure how people can put a percentage figure on how much improvement a tonsillectomy has on their breath. 10 to 15% seems very low to me and suggests that either their tonsil and stones were not as bad as they thought or their other established breath problem was worse. Both my ENT and surgeon were not convinced that their removal would significantly change my other symptoms though not necessarily BB. As you are probably aware their interest in this topic is negligible so no real surprise there. I think the grounds for removal on the NHS is one of necessity. If your tonsils are producing stones and excretion on an almost daily basis then they are chronically infected and should be removed irrespective of the BB issue. Some NHS trusts have shorter waiting times for adult tonsillectomies than for children so give them a ring. If your consultant thinks they warrant it you may get seen within a few months. I considered the laser treatment in London but from research total removal was the most effective way to be rid. My tongue coating varies from day to day and time of day. For 3 days post op I had no significant coating, no mucous, no globus,no bb...don't know why but I think the key was no mucous or reflux. If I am stressed or talking a lot (both oxygen reducing activities) it worsens considerably. I know it is bad as I sense a stinging sensation in my mouth which I thought must be acid but now who knows.You will know when you are having a good day.....you just sense it. Your tongue will have glisten on it although towards the rear there will a light white coating. I think even those without BB have this. Irrespective of the tonsils if the mucous (PND or otherwise) is still being produced you still have some form of breath issue. It settles in the throat and back of the tongue and feeds the bacteria which are now out of balance. I drink plenty of water especially out and about or at work and chew sugar free gum for saliva (why do I bother ?) . My oral regime has improved 10 fold (. . damage already done ? ) My diet would be classed as typically British (fairly unhealthy). For 5 months I went without alcohol, dairy and cut down on sugars, spicy food etc. Still had all the symptoms and stones or BB did not improve. If you feel you have LPR induced symptoms then I think the etiology of the problem can be simplified thus : 1. reflux (silent for period of time but in some oral flora being gradually changed) 2. first symptoms : globus. . blocked nose...pnd/excess mucous...constant throat clearing...acid bitter taste ...white tongue coating and bb (only in those whose flora imbalanced) 3. cryptic tonsils and stones (can occur without LPR but not without PND) 4. symptoms established : try antacids,H2 blockers,PPI's,lifestyle/diet 5. symptoms still exist : corrective fundoplication surgery for loose sphincter or hiatus hernia 6. symptoms gone : hopefully Hope helps Yeah could be flying a kite with the old PH theory. The general opinion on the bb thread is that BB bacteria produce more odour in an alkaline enviroment. It still does not add up. If I have experienced acid reflux right into my oral cavity in terms of bitter taste and that the symptoms I have experienced can all be associated with LPR. My ENT feels I have LPR ...then how can I have an alkaline PH ? All we have been told is that anaerobic bacteria on tongue, gums, throat are responsible for the malodour. They can only live in an environment with no oxygen. Alkaline environments are oxygen enriched. I think non BB sufferers produce enough of this saliva to naturally cleanse and neutralize the bacteria. The one and only time they get BB outside certain foods is after a night's sleep where the saliva glands effectively shut down giving their bacteria a chance to take hold. However, upon waking their saliva glands start doing their good work again. If working on the acidid PH theory then that means that non sufferers either have a highly acidic mouth which is then brought to below neutral by alkaline saliva or the saliva itself is in some form acidic....which defies logic. After all to have a ph around 6 to 6.5 say would still cause some degree of enamel and gum damage. I think I will do the test myself and see what happens. Sorry for bending your ear on this one. Need to start taking those brevity pills again. Ginger "}, "8": {"a": "23005", "t": "Note to Garrett, Sartor and Never (how are you ?) Underwent Upper GI or endoscopy. Not to be recommended...... by far the most uncomfortable experience I have ever had. A tonsillectomy is a day out compared to this. Anyway as I suspected they found no tissue damage to the oesophaegus ( I told them that they wouldn't....what is the medical profession's obsession with Heartburn ?) but they did see evidence that reflux had taken place. They found I had a sliding hiatus hernia (something else I suspected.....my primary health doctor/ GP deserves the sack) but that this was not uncommon and nothing to worry about (yeah right). They did a stomach /duodenal biopsy and found that I have H.pylori bacteria (something else I suspected) and this may be the cause of the reflux symptoms. When pressed about the globus sensation and the excess mucous /PND the consultant seemed unsure and suggested that it me down to my tonsils. What ! I had these symptoms long before they were removed. It looks like the pylori has caused antral gastritis which I understand (though not from him) is a relatively serious condition. My own view is that the H.Pylori stacks up since I did suffer from a peptic ulcer for a number of years but the endoscopy supports my own feelings on that this healed some time ago as there was no evidence of current ulcerations. This seems contradictory since if pylori causes the ulceration in the first place how can it heal in the presence of the bacterium. I can only assume that my stomach acid levels themselves have reduced significantly to allow this healing and this would explain how the reflux is not causing heartburn on its way up. There is a view that pylori and BB are linked and some important research from Turkey showed that nearly all pylori diagnosed participants also had recognised BB problems. Upon treatment for the pylori the BB went away. V. Interesting. Any decision re fundoplication will be taken after the 24 hr Ph monitoring in June. In the meantime I think I will make arrangements for a barium X ray which shows any problems with the upper and lower sphincters better than the endoscopy. I feel that the sliding hiatus hernia is the problem and is interfering with the proper functioning of the lower sphincter allowing acid to reflux. Advice such as try not to bend down is nonsense. If something is not working then it needs to fixed. I do want to go on PPI's again as the side effects are not good. A greater understanding of and interest in LPR is needed in the UK. This diagnosis by numbers is damaging. If the Heliclear makes a difference I will post again to let you know. Note to Sartor My saliva PH findings showed me always in the acidic range. Urine PH is unhealthy acidic. My partner saliva mostly neutral or slightly alkaline except upon waking when slightly acidic. "}, "9": {"a": "23005", "t": "Note to Sartor My thoughts about reflux, acidic mouth, and BB are derived from various sources which you can find on the net. (Cannot give exact external sites here) Exponents of alkalinity state that saliva PH should be the same as blood at 7.4. Dental research shows that plaque is formed and enamel damage takes place in an acidic oral environment. Also why are all these breath products alkalising or oygenising. Surely if slightly acidic was best they would be promoting that. The bacteria are anaerobic and an acidic enviroment is anaerobic. It really comes down to how you interpret what is how there.This makes sense to me and my particular situation. There is contradictory bacterial research in respect of the tongue dorsum. Some say growth is diminished at slightly acidic PH others say streptococcus bacteria favour an anaerobic acidic environment. See Medinet for wealth of oral bacterial research much of which is from Japan. Also see below: \"People with lung diseases have bad breath, according to scientists at the University of Virginia. Researchers say people with conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis have highly acidic breath. They said doctors should be able to distinguish between healthy patients and those with lung diseases quite easily. This is because healthy people have breath which is slightly alkaline. They asked 100 healthy patients to breathe into a disposable breathalyser providing four samples a day for seven consecutive days and found that their pH levels remained relatively stable and slightly alkaline. (BBC Health website) PS How are u doing ? How are the tonsil stones ? Best Wishes "}, "10": {"a": "23005", "t": "A note to Sartor If you are still having problems with the tonsils I would get rid. The extent to which they improve your breath will not be known till afterwards. They are definitely a factor and you will notice a difference. As long you have PND and bacteria you will get stones and excretions. However, you must bear in mind as I have found out if you still have PND and anaerobic tongue and throat bacteria (all reflux induced) you will still get BB. In respect of oral malodor research you will find great detail about the bacteria that contributes to BB but nothing as to why they exist in some people more than others or what causes it. They simply do not know why other than to say they are largely anaerobic. In the absence of this one review study concluded that it could well be as the result of exposure to low level reflux over a long period of time. (can't remember the study but I think it was the University of Helsinki). It just seems to make sense to my situation. The whole study area of oral bacteriology is vast but you could look at Hailmeter, Microbiology or Medinet sites. There are articles on how PH influences bacterial changes but nothing on the effects of reflux. Perhaps ENT or Gastro journals would have it. My view is based on my own personal experience and references elsewhere. Dr Grossan (inventor of Hydropulse Irrigator) states that sinus problems and PND can be caused by stomach acid reaching the throat and nasal passage. The Sinus Centre (US website) states most PND caused by LPR. Healthy mouth is neutral to slightly alkaline PH. I am mostly acidic. I never experienced the BB until I noticed the burning mouth, PND and globus. Any improvement in my BB seems linked to improvements in my LPR so for me there is a direct correlation. I am aware that any correction of the LPR (which for me will probably be surgery) will not in itself eradicate the BB bacteria overnight but I believe it will at least give me a proper chance to get my oral balance right again. If I do not address the reflux I will never get rid of the BB.

The uMMA (more sensitive than the serum MMA) & homocystiene tests are very important as they will pick up a deficiency if your levels are normal the levels really need to be upgraded normal is different for all and anything under 550 can present symptoms you should also get tested for Red Cell Folate.... I have come te experience that the type of B12 is crucial indeed...Here in Aus we normally treat defiencies this way Hydroxocobalamin injection everyday for 7days then breaking down to just 1 every 3 months that will work on correcting blood problems like PA but you will not get to much other healing.....Hydroxo needs to be converted as does Cyanocobalamin (one I would aviod all together) to Methylcobalamin and Adynosedylcobalamin (i havent spelt that write) I was having Hydroxo injections with not much help my new Dr treats it differently and rather aggresively I now have Methylcobalamin injections of 10,000mcg 3 x a week for 3 months then we will go down to 2 ect I also take sublinguals 5000mcg everyday and multi vitamin and folic acid...Folic acid is a crucial cofactor for B12........I was really ill with numbness and pins and needles memory loss, extreme anxiety ,elctrical like pains in my body, vision problems, foggy head,fatigue,positive for rombergs (fell over all the time when I closed my eyes) couldnt walk well in the dark, couldnt talk properly (by now my husband was getting really really concerned)........I was told that most of my symptoms because of there duartion would stay with me,,,,,,,but that is wrong I have no more numbness or back pains ect.....My stomcah issue were the first to heal I can think clearly have great energy ect I have had 17 injections and big doses as you can see but I am healing & I know i have the Methyl & my doc to thank for it....Methyl is the active form of B12 so it does not need to be converted and is taken up more into the cells.... Some peolpe I know also needed ADB12 which greatly improved their energy levels...... My doc said I was low in folate so I neede supplements but it is crucial when having B12 injections as they work together and large doses of B12 can pull down the folate this works a treat for me I take one with my injections.... I feel that docs pay to much attention to lab levels if you have been having injections and the levels go up which they will most of it is just circulating and not used anyway and the say oh lets just give them to you every month this is not going to heal damage done it is just not enough the healing takes a while and you need to saturate the system with it...If one is still having the symptoms you must address it more than 1 per month even if the docs say no you can treat yourself with the sublinguals using methylcobalamin...... .

You ask a fair enough question and i will do my best to explainn it as i know it The docs usually will take another serum reading after the patient has been offthe B12 for say amonth b12 doesnt stay very long in the system so they usually will give a few injections hoping that it will biuld up & then test agian. . if it is still low they may give injections more regularly or if its higher they may pull back a bit...... . You are right the blood readings are always not reflective of what in the cells that is why the uMMA & Hcy tests are more conclusive........ I personally think you are better off going by how you feel when you are having thereapy for example the injections or subs or pills may reflective a higher serum level but you can still be having neuro signs to help with alot of these symptoms you really need to saturate the system and the levels should be around 2000 and maintained there for healing to take place this has been my experience and the same for many others I know it is also important to have B12s cofactors as well..............

Ruth "}, "1": {"a": "1642", "t": "I'm not sure where the \"iliac\" nodes would be, but I suspect near the groin? Okay, here are the tests I had: CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis. PET scan - entire body cystoscopy of bladder intravenous pylogram (scans kidneys) pelvic exam including endometrial biopsy I had just had a colonoscopy only a few months before I discovered the lump, so they didn't repeat that, but the would have done one if I hadn't had one so recently. I discovered the lump the last week in February, but waited about two weeks to see if it went away, thinking it was just a swollen gland (I'd had one in the groin many, many years before, and that's all it turned out to be back then - definitely not related to this cancer, as it was over 30 years ago). Then I called my doctor and made an appointment. Got in the first week in March, and then was immediately scheduled to see the surgeon, probably about the third week in March. Saw him, he scheduled surgery for second week in April. Had all the tests done after the surgery, so that took up another several weeks. Didn't start treatment until mid or late May. So, don't worry about a few weeks delay...or even up to a month or 6 weeks. It probably won't make a difference. You definitely will, however, need systemic treatment, as it's in nodes in two different areas. Unfortunately chemotherapy is the only way to guarantee that any stray cancer cells are killed. If you're like me, the waiting is probably the worst part of this whole thing. At least once treatment was started, I knew that I was taking action to beat this, and that felt good, emotionally. But while you're waiting, please do try to be positive. As I said, this is a highly curable type of cancer (squamous cell), and there's no reason at this point to think you won't be cured.

At any rate, chemo: Well, I had a combination of taxol and carboplatin. The taxol does not cause nausea, but it can cause muscle and joint pain and, since I already have fibromyalgia, it wasn't pleasant. I had four treatments. I was fine the day of treatment and until about 4 PM the next day, and that's when the pain would hit. I learned after the first treatment to start taking vicodin about 3 PM on the day following chemo, and I would have to take it every 3 1/2 hours for the rest of that day and the next. By day 4 I was able to cut back to one every 6 hours, and by day 5, I only needed two vicodin. By Sunday I didn't need it at all, and I'd be fine for the next two+ weeks until the next treatment. I did experience neuropathy from the taxol - my doctors were concerned that it'd be really bad for me because I'm diabetic, and it [I]was/I] really bad, but eased up somewhat after I stopped treatments. I ended up wearing heal cups in my shoes for about 6 months and by the end of that time, the neuropathy was totally gone. The carboplatin causes both hair loss and nausea. Can't do much about the hair loss...I wore bandanas to go with my outfits and nice straw hats - looked more fashionable than I'd ever looked before that, lol. And my doctor treated me with IV Zofran before the chemo treatments and some oral meds for 3 days afterwards. I never lost my appetite at all...in fact, I gained 3 pounds during this time (then went on a cruise and lost 3 pounds that week, totally surprising my doc and making him wonder what the heck was wrong with me, lol!) But of course, the answer was that during chemo, I ate a lot of ice cream, as I had no energy to make meals and no one to do it for me, and then I walked a lot on the cruise. I chose to have a port put in, as I didn't think my veins would thank me for 5 hours of IV treatments. I kept the port in for about two years and then finally had it removed when it looked like I definitely wasn't going to need it any more. The only downside to the port is that it has to be flushed, I think it was every 4 weeks (that's after chemo...of course it gets flushed right before each chemo treatment.) And they did my chemo first, and then the radiation, which I think is fairly common. Radiation only gets the local cancer and, especially in CUP, since they don't know where the primary is and whether it's still spewing out cancer cells, chemo is the first line of defense as it gets the cells all over the body. In the final analysis, this experience wasn't the most fun I've ever had, but it was well worth it and I'd do it again if I needed to without hesitation. But then, I'm an old hand at dealing with medical problems, since I've had nothing since I was 30. Renal stenosis and high blood pressure, heart attack, GERD, diabetes, fibromyalgia, stroke, and cancer twice (the second time was bladder CA.) At this point, to me anyway, it's just another thing to get through...keep putting one foot in front of the other and eventually you'll get there! Ruth "}, "3": {"a": "1642", "t": "Cindy, I'm not sure what those chemo letters stand for - the ones you had before - but it is absolutely imperative that they treat you with IV anti-emetics BEFORE they give the chemo. If they don't, the nausea will start right away and you can't stop it. But with the IV treatment before hand, you don't get nauseous, and you're then able to take the pills for the next few days. When you're ready to start chemo, INSIST that they give you IV zofran, kitryl or anzamet. Plus anti-nausea pills to take for the next several days. I've know people who've gone to Dana Farber and they waited to treat nausea IF they got nauseous - by then it's too late. My doc is very aggressive about preventing side effects. As for how long the treatment will be...that 5 hours for me included the IV anti-emetic time, plus another IV treatment to combat possible allergic reactions to taxol. It all varies a bit depending on what they're going to treat you with. As for the port, they give you some anesthesia when they put it in...but it's a very light anesthetic, as it only takes a short time to insert it. When they finally took it out, I just had a local. It hurts a bit when they stick the IV into it, but not really all that much...but since I'm diabetic and needles hold no fear for me, it didn't seem like a big deal. And it was much more comfortable than a regular IV, I think...they can never get regular IV's into my veins without a struggle. Getting into the port was a piece of cake compared to some of the IV's I've had. Oh, I don't think yours is any worse than mine...they took out a ton of nodes, from what I understand, and I was sore all the way up to my underarm, so I know they dug around quite a bit. Honestly, Cindy...as bad as all this is, and I'm not making light of it, squamous cell is so highly curable that I actually consider it lucky that that's what you've got. Sure, it's a lot to get through, but focus on the end results, which should definitely be a complete cure. I finished all treatment in October of 2001, and I've had no recurrences! And I've spoken to at least 4 other people who had exactly the same thing and have survived cancer-free for many years. Do try to stay positive and if you find your mind is really making you nuts and you can't eat, consider asking your doctor for some mild tranquilizers to get you through. You need to keep up your strength, especially now, going into this. Also, try fruit smoothies with yogurt...very nutritious and easy to get down, as well as Ensure. Hang in there, cindy! Ruth "}, "4": {"a": "1642", "t": "When they say they put the Zofran in the chemo bag, they may mean that they give it right before the chemo...I think all those medications come in separate bags, so they hang the Zofran first, then the chemo (or the antihystamine and then the chemo, if an antihystamine is necessary). And yes, I did have radiation. Mine was targeted to a very small area, where the main tumor was in the groin...they couldn't get all of that tumor because it had already adhered to the main femoral artery, so they wanted to zap what was left with radiation. It was easy, and caused no problems, not even a radiation burn. Did cause permanent hair loss in that area, but it's a small area and no one sees it, lol. Hopefully the lexapro will work. It takes 2-4 weeks for any antidepressant to really kick in. Don't know if they'd give you a script for lorazepam along with it, but lorazepam is a very mild anti-anxiety med that acts immediately...it's mildly narcotic, so you don't want to take it on a regular basis, but for those awful nights you can't sleep for worrying, or your stomach is just twisted in knots, the lorazepam can really help. I take an antidepressant for sleep issues because of the fibro, but every once in a while I still get wicked insomnia, so I'll take a lorazepam (once!) to get my sleep back on track. Good to have on hand just in case. I really think you shouldn't have much trouble with nausea this time...those anti-emetics are really quite effective. Ruth "}, "5": {"a": "1642", "t": "Hi Cindy, Don't worry about asking too many questions...when your mind is all stressed out, it's very hard to organize your thoughts and ask all questions at once. I know because I've been there, done that! You might want to take a tape recorder with you to doctors appointments so you can remember all the info. My doc was fine with it, as are most docs when you explain why you want to record. I got chemo in the doctor's office. He had a clinic attached to his office - a room with about 8 reclining chairs for patients getting chemo. It was so nice to not have to check in with all the hospital bureaucracy each time. My blood counts never dropped so far that they had to put off chemo. The one big problem I had is that being diabetic and having to take major steroids the night before chemo, my blood sugars were incredibly high for two days. That probably also affected how debilitated I was...high energy from the decadron plus high blood sugars for two days followed by a drop in energy when the decadron wore off plus blood sugars still not back to normal...luckily I don't produce ketones, or I would have had to be hospitalized for chemo. As far as the nodes, I'm not quite sure how many were removed, but I know it was more than just one or two. I think you're probably okay taking a lorazepam even every night to sleep...just don't start taking it several times a day every single day...that could be problematic down the road. And taking Zantac is a good idea for now...and if that doesn't work, ask for omeprazole (the generic version of Prilosec). This might seem like the worst time in the world to try this, but have you thought about meditation to relax you? If you don't meditate on a regular basis, the easiest way to get into it is to find a guided meditation CD...a type called Yoga Nidra is excellent...someone is talking to you the entire time, guiding you through relaxation and visualization. It's sometimes called \"yogic sleep\"...you're not really asleep, but in that relaxed state just before you fall asleep. It's truly a wonderful practice...leaves you feeling both relaxed and energized at the same time. And there's usually a time during it when you can concentrate on breathing in white light and having it heal your body...very satisfying! I did yogic breathing and visualization during both my chemo and radiation treatments. And I was probably the most relaxed patient in the clinic, thanks to that! Stay strong, Cindy, and try to stay calm. This is just one of those speed bumps in life - you went over one years ago and survived, and you will survive this one, too! Ruth "}, "6": {"a": "1642", "t": "Hi Cindy, The answer is to stop reading those nasty stories, lol. Where did you read that stuff about second cancers after Hodgins? If it wasn't a reputable site (such as NIH, Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society, etc.) just ignore it. Plus, you had Hodgkins soooo long ago that I doubt it's even relevant now. Have they told you yet exactly what chemo you're going to be on? It's important to know, so you can prepare to deal with any side effects. It's way better to be prepared in advance than to be surprised...trust me on that! Make sure you're getting enough sleep, as being sleep deprived can make you start feeling worse, both emotionally and physically. Believe it or not, you'll probably start feeling better emotionally once you start treatment...it's much more empowering to feel you're actually doing something about the cancer than sitting around waiting. Ruth "}, "7": {"a": "1642", "t": "For me, chemo was difficult the week of...day one, 5 hours in the chemo chair. But no pain that day or most of the next. Day 2 by 4 PM the aches and pains started, and I'd be down for the count and on Vicodin round the clock for the rest of that day and the next two days. By day 5 I only needed two vicodin (one AM and one before bed), and although I was still tired, I was beginning to feel human. By day 6 I could go out for a short period of time, and by day 7 I was almost back to normal. For the next two weeks, life was completely normal. As I said, Cindy...it wasn't exactly easy, but it was definitely do-able. And remember...I'm also diabetic and have fibromyalgia, both of which made dealing with chemo that much worse. That's why I think if I could do it, anyone can. Also, on my chemo...I don't remember dry mouth, so if I had it at all, it wasn't bad. And I had no mouth sores. Also, other than the fibroymyalgia, which always makes me tired, I didn't notice any difference in my energy or digestive system before I found the lump. Keep in mind that every type of chemo is different, and every person will have somewhat of an individual reaction to the same type of chemo, but usually people will have similar reactions to the same chemo. Once you know what kind of chemo they're going to give you, then you can look up the potential side effects and be prepared. Also, not everyone will get every single possible side effect! But being prepared really helps, as in anti-nausea meds, laxatives and stool softeners if necessary, extra body lotion for dry skin, etc., etc. A friend of my has a t-shirt that I absolutely LOVE...it says on it...... \"Worry is NOT preparation.\" How true! Worry accomplishes nothing; preparation not only accomplishes something, it helps alleviate the worry! So now I guess you just have to wait for the last biopsies and you'll find out what the course of action is going to be. Once you know that, you can prepare. And, again, please try to be optimistic...squamous cell cancer is very curable and even though the treatment may not be fun, it's nice to know there's a brighter world on the other side of the treatment. Ruth "}, "8": {"a": "1642", "t": "Cindy, What exactly did the pathology from the groin nodule say? Did they do any surgery, or did they just do a needle aspiration? They need to narrow it down as much as possible, and pathology of the nodule can tell them if the cancer cells at least have SOME similarities to some kind of cells; then they can use chemo that treats that sort of cell. My cancer was poorly differentiated, meaning they couldn't tell exactly what it was, but it did have similarities to both squamous and small cell cancers. If they've determined that yours is squamous cell, then that's how they need to treat it. No, the shaky and tired is probably not from cancer, but more likely from the lexapro or simply from the CFS and Fibro...stress makes those illnesses worse, so it's not surprising that you're having so much trouble functioning. But it's also a good idea to take the lexapro just before bedtime so if that IS what's causing the exhaustion, you'll be more likely to sleep it off and be more alert during the day. I so wish I could impart my ability to just go with the flow...I'm very lucky that way. Not that I didn't have some emotional impact with the cancer diagnosis, but I seem to be able to just concentrate on each day and not worry too much about the future. Yes, the chemo will be difficult, but attitude can help. If you THINK it's going to be awful, it'll be worse. If you THINK you can get through it, it'll be not quite as bad. And again, don't forget that you were treated for the first cancer 23 years ago...they have so many ways to combat the side effects now that it definitely won't be like the first time, and you really have to keep that in mind and believe it'll be better than last time. Ruth "}, "9": {"a": "1642", "t": "I'm sorry that your doctors aren't more supportive. Where in Rhode Island do you live? Could you possibly be treated in Mass? I can highly recommend my own oncologist, and he's in Norwood, which is only about 20-30 minutes over the RI line on 95. At the very least, at this point, I would say to my doctors - \"enough testing already. We know from the pathology that it's squamous cell, let's just start treating it.\" Really, since this was metastatic, they need to do chemo anyway, and I don't think finding the primary site will make one slight bit of difference in the treatment. As for the Ensure being high in sugar...it's total carbs that count for a diabetic, and if the carb count is under 50, that's okay for a meal. If it's much less than that, you can even add some regular food to the meal, if you can keep it down. Cindy, this is hard to say, but I'm thinking that you may want to see a psychologist for regular therapy, at least as long as you're going through this medical nightmare. It's obviously taking a huge toll on you already, and I'm wondering if you could find a therapist who has experience in dealing with cancer patients? Perhaps you could find one through a local cancer support group...heck, maybe even participating in a local cancer support group is all the help you need But you know that it's going to be important to keep your strength up and get enough sleep while you're going through this, and I think perhaps your fear is, understandably, taking over. I'm more than happy to keep corresponding with you (and we definitely will!) , and I'm pleased that I've been able to help you, but I think you need more than just a faceless person on the internet right now. Please do look into cancer support groups in your area. ((((WARM HUGS)))) Ruth "}, "10": {"a": "1642", "t": "Hi Cindy, So sorry I didn't see your message about Penney until tonight. I feel so bad for you, having to deal with the loss of your pet on top of everything else. I'm also an animal person and sadly I know all too well the grief one feels over the loss of a long-time companion. My heart goes out to you and your family. And, wow...that's a surprise, about the anal skin tag. But isn't it still squamous cell carcinoma? The designation CUP just means they can't tell exactly where it originated...well, now you know where it originated, but it's still squamous I would think...so nothing has really changed. If this is, in fact, still squamous cell, then you're probably going to be treated with taxol and carboplatin. For sure, Taxol is given once every three weeks. so that's what it sounds like your doctors are planning. Get some specifics asap, and then you can get prepared. Honestly, preparation is the key to feeling sane, in my opinion. And hopefully, you'll actually start feeling better mentally when you start treatment...at least, I know that I did. Okay...so next step is to call and ask exactly what chemo you'll be getting. Then call the American Cancer Society and they'll send you fact sheets on those chemos...or you can research them online. Yes, you're probably going to lose your hair...taxol doesn't cause hair loss, but other chemos do and you'll probably get some sort of combo chemo. I actually have such a love/hate (mostly hate) relationship with my hair that I didn't mind losing it at all...what a relief not to have to wash and blow dry it every single day. As soon as it started coming out, I went to my hairdresser and had it all shaved off. I got a few nice straw hats and LOTS of bandanas and wore a bandana to match my clothes under the hats...looked more fashionable than ever before, lol. I got lots of comments on how stunning my hats looked from people who had no idea I was going through chemo, which really made me laugh! So, find out what you're going to be treated with, and let me know. Meanwhile, lots of hugs to you, and stay hopeful always. Ruth "}, "11": {"a": "1642", "t": "Hi Cindy, Just checking in to see how you're doing, and if you got any more news today. Just wanted you to know I'm thinking of you. Hugs, Ruth "}, "12": {"a": "1642", "t": "Hi Cindy, Wow, chemo and radiation at the same time...whew! Don't know too much about cisplatin, but I think it's stronger than carboplatin. My mom did have 5FU (along with methotrexate), and she had no nausea, and that was before they had the IV anti-emetics...but, on the other hand, she didn't have cisplatin. Cisplatin definitely can cause nausea, so insist that they give you anti-nausea medication intravenously BEFORE they infuse the cisplatin, and they should also give you oral anti-nausea meds to take for the next several days (and take them, even if you don't think you need them!) They should also give you compazine suppositories, but if you do the other two things, you probably won't need them. Also, if the iv anti-emetic doesn't work for you the first time out, have them try a different one the next time...but the likelihood is that any one of them will definitely work. Also ask if this chemo tends to make you constipated (many do)...and if so, get some sennekot tablets and some colace(it's available in a generic, too, far cheaper). Use both, as the constipation from chemo can be very, very bad, It's easier to prevent problems if you start using this stuff right away, before you actually get constipated, than to try to deal with it after the fact. You can google these chemotherapies and get a lot of information, but I caution you not get upset - the fact is, they have to list every possible side effect, but not everyone gets any of them. The nausea/constipation are ones I've heard most people complain about when getting chemo, so those are ones you should definitely be prepared for, and luckily, those are the ones you can actually do something about. One thing I did during radiation that made me feel great was to visualize a little \"maintenance manager\" cleanup cell inside my body where the tumor was who was pushing all the dead and dying bad cells with a pushbroom into a stream that was washing them out of my body. It was a \"he\", and he looked kind of like a miniature Mr. Clean in red, lol. Really...sounds pretty fantastical, but it gave me something positive to concentrate on while I was on the table and each radiation treatment made me feel really hopeful. . I guess there IS something to that theory of positive thinking. I'll be going to the Cape on Saturday, but I'll check in with you again before I go, and will probably get online at least once while we're down there I won't have a laptop with me, but can probably use the online connection at the library, so I'll try to check in again either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Hopefully rather than be apprehensive, you'll start to become excited by the fact that, FINALLY, you'll be taking action to beat this thing - I surely hope so! Stay hopeful, stay strong, and BELIEVE you can beat this, too. Hugs, Ruth "}, "13": {"a": "1642", "t": "Hi Cindy, Just got back from the Cape a couple of hours ago and wanted to check in with you and wish you luck with getting the port tomorrow. When is your first chemo scheduled for? Yes, cisplatin IS strong, but I think it's a good chemo for what you have...and I've always believed in hitting it with all guns blazing right from the beginning, so all those nasty mutated cells get zapped and don't have a chance to escape (see my radiation visualization above). I also am a true believer in positive thinking. The way I look at it is this...it may not actually cure anything, but it'll make the process a lot easier than if you feed fear and negativity. Let me know how it goes tomorrow...and when is your first chemo treatment? Ruth "}, "14": {"a": "1642", "t": "Yep...take the anti-nausea meds whether you feel nauseous or not. Sometimes, despite getting the IV anti-nausea medication, you might start feeling queasy the next day. The meds work far better to PREVENT nausea than to stop it once it really gets hold of you. As for pain...well, I had taxol, which definitely causes a lot of pain (muscles and joints), and since I already have fibromyalgia, it was pretty rough for me. The pain usually started about 24 hours after chemo was finished, and I took Vicodin every 3.5 hours for the next 3 days (and mostly stayed in bed), after that, the pain diminished pretty rapidly. I'm pretty certain that 5FU does not cause pain, but I don't know about mito C.. . in fact, I never heard of that one. Even without nausea, going through chemo and radiation (especially at the same time...I did mine consecutively, not concurrently) is going to be, at best, exhausting. But hopefully that's ALL it'll be...and once you're through, you'll start feeling better. I'll try to check the board every night to see how you're doing. Hugs, Ruth "}, "15": {"a": "1642", "t": "Hi Cindy, Hope the first day went okay...sounds like an ordeal, being hooked up for that long. But it sounds like they're doing a good job with the Zofran...did they give you any other anti-nausea meds to take when you got home? I was given some sort of pills - don't remember what they were, but I think possibly Zofran in a pill form - plus Compazine suppositories, just in case I couldn't get the pills down. I was told to take a pill once a day for three days. Had no trouble getting them down and never needed the Compazine. From my understanding, the chemo can make you queasy for a couple of days afterwards, which is why they give you more anti-nausea meds to take for the next three days. Nope, I didn't get mouth sores at all - hope you don't get them either this time, but I know everyone's body acts individually, so it's hard to say whether or not your symptoms will be the same as the next person's symptoms. Just try not to psych yourself INTO getting symptoms...this chemo is also different from the last time you had chemo, so your symptoms also will probably not be the same. Sorry I wasn't able to check in for the past couple of days, but hope you're doing better, and will check in again tomorrow or Sunday. Ruth "}, "16": {"a": "1642", "t": "Oh, Cindy...that's just awful. And it happened so quickly...after just one treatment. I so hope that they can figure out something to make you more comfortable. As for the queasiness...did they give you any anti-nausea pills to take? They really should...the chemo can make you queasy for several days, and it makes you a lot more comfortable if you don't have to feel that queasiness on top of everything else. Wish I could remember what pills they gave me, but I know they also gave me Compazine suppositories as a back-up, but the pills alone worked well for me. Well, this really stinks but, okay...you've got about 6 weeks to get through. Hopefully this will work and at that point you'll start recovering. Please, please don't give up hope. After all, the last time you had cancer, as bad as the treatment was, it worked for a couple of decades, right? So THAT's what you probably need to focus on...not how awful this is, not how bad anal cancer can be (heck, ALL cancer is bad), but the fact that you survived cancer before and you can do it again. There's a great quotation from Emily Dickinson about hope: ? Hope is the thing with feathers, that perches in the soul, and sings the tune without words, and never stops at all. ? Don't let it stop! Big hugs to you, Ruth "}, "17": {"a": "1642", "t": "No...what happened with the marinol? Did you have a bad reaction? And why did they give it to you...I thought they pretty much reserved that for cases where the other anti-nausea meds fail, but I could be wrong about that. At my first chemo treatment, they gave me IV benadryl to prevent allergic reaction to the Taxol...well, I had a very severe anomalous reaction...got so jumpy and jittery, I couldn't stay still in the chemo chair. They ended up having to give me IV ativan to counteract it. Wouldn't it be nice if they could test us first to figure out IF we could take a medicine, without our having to take it and suffer side effects? <sigh> In a perfect world, maybe. And are you using the glutamine yet? Hope you get some good sleep tonight. Ruth "}, "18": {"a": "1642", "t": "Argghhh...how stupid is THAT...to not have a doctor on call when giving chemo??? People have been known to have really serious reactions to various chemos. Either that, or it was a really stupid nurse. Gosh, what an awful ordeal. And all your side effects are from stress? Did they just start after you had the chemo (the eczema, mouth sores, headache, etc.?) If so, there's no way a stress reaction would happen that quickly, unless they're talking about a physical stress reaction to the chemicals, in which case they should be taking this more seriously. Sure, you're going to have side effects - they're not always completely preventable - but there should be something they can do to ease the discomfort. Can you talk to your doctor about this? I know if I called my doctor with these problems, he'd call me back right away or fit me in for an appointment immediately (well, if it were my oncologist, they would have already given me whatever was needed to prevent this or ease the discomfort - in ADVANCE, before they sent me home from chemo). I am so very sorry that you're having to go through this. It sounds just awful. But then, the pain from my chemo was absolutely awful, too...I just lay on the couch or in my bed for 3-4 days after each treatment, taking pain pills every 3 hours, and sleeping as much as I could. After the first chemo treatment, I knew what to expect, so after that I just expected that I was going to be in pain and absolutely unfunctional for 3-4 days each time and I just planned for that. It was just something to get through...for some reason I was able to accept it and not dwell on the awfulness of it. Don't ask me why...some sort of gift from God, I think. May whatever power you believe in grant you that same gift. Are you having the chemo once a week? Or is it once every 3 weeks?

I wanted you to know that I've been thinking of you and praying for you. As for the blood counts...they go low, it happens, they just delay the next chemo for a week or so, and it usually doesn't make the slightest bit of difference. The cancer doesn't have a chance to take over just from those small delays, so just don't worry about it. The biggest thing is to make sure you're not exposed to a lot of illnesses...so frequent hand-washing and even, if your counts are that low, wearing a face mask when out in the public, can protect you from catching any viruses floating around.

I know it's really hard to think of this when you're just so very, miserably uncomfortable, but if you can think of it as just something you have to get through...marking the days off the calendar...it's probably better than concentrating on how miserable you are. I know...it doesn't work for everyone...but I've often found that, for myself, concentrating on pain or discomfort actually makes me feel worse! I have some other painful physical conditions, but I'm finding that if I concentrate on something else (funny movie, good book, just going to sleep, doing crafts, etc.) I get through several hours without noticing how much pain I'm in. Probably during chemo you won't have the energy to do much else, but funny movies and books are usually do-able even when you're exhausted.

Do you think that they are the cause of you dizziness? Just wondering because sometimes I think they do cause this "}, "1": {"a": "10032", "t": "Tesss, You CAN do it! One of the greatest lessons that came out of dealing with this condition for me was that \"everything in it's own time\". So, don't give up when you are frustrated and scared (and you will be both for a while). It's a natural reaction to feeling so 'unnatural' with your symptoms. And it's okay to ask someone else to drive - as long as you keep giving driving yourself a good try in some small amount at least every other day. As for feeling sick with the thought of driving again - been there. I still get that blechy feeling sometimes - I know that most of it is due to anxiety issues as it relates to my symptoms, but that doesn't make it any easier. But I also know that sometimes my head is too \"off\" to drive - it's that simple. And when I truly know that I can't push past a moment or day because my symptoms are simply too much, I will make the decision not to drive and not guilt myself over it. You're not a freak of any kind if you need someone to help you out, whether it's driving or something else. I rely on family and friends and even co-workers when I need it, and I just have to be careful not to get into a cycle where it's easier to rely than do it myself. But everyone needs a break now and then, and there's no shame in asking for help or not being able to do something, whether it's out of a physical limitation or just plain old fear. The important thing is that you work on getting past your limitations in a small way, every day. Whether it's walking down the hallways stairs with the lights off, or trying for a walk around the block (used to be a toughie for me), or simply trying to lie still in bed when your head is swaying. Just remember that you are an able healthy person, even with some limitations, and once you gain some trust in yourself (again) that you CAN move your muscles despite your symptoms, that will be half the anxiety battle for you. During my worst challenging times (and I still have them) I lived by this quote, \" \". Persevere, accept encouragement and help, and remember that you are okay despite your symptoms. Yes, I want to hear EVERY DETAIL about your test drive, even if you only make down the driveway and back. xo "}, "2": {"a": "10032", "t": "Tesss, How did the test drive go for you???? "}, "3": {"a": "10032", "t": "Tess! EXCELLENT driving! Don't think of is as \"only two miles\" - for some people, two miles is a lifetime! Instead, think of it as \"yeah, only two miles TODAY, more to come\"! I agree that sometimes it's the anxiety that overshadows the symptoms! For me, this is especially true while driving. Plus the worry-thoughts of \"what happens if my symptoms escalate (while I'm driving)\". I get a kick out of well intended encouragers who say things like, \"it's only 15 miles to work, no big deal\". Okay, you try driving with a plastic bad over your head and a bag of bricks pushing you to one side or the other, throw in a few head rushes if you turn to fast and oh, make sure you spin around three times really fast before you jump in the car to make a turn on a busy street. OF COURSE it's a big deal. But I know those encouragements are made out of caring and the wish to see me persevere rather than anything else. I like the idea of your plan to try to drive a little every other day, even if your symptoms are really bothersome. I have found that pushing myself a little on the days when I think I truly can't, empowers me to know that I really CAN, and it makes the tolerable symptom-days easier to do more. I'm sure you'll do fine on the short trip to your MD about your GERD. It's great practice at not only driving, but doing an event by yourself despite your symptoms (that can be uncom,fortable and anxiety provoking I know). So, GOOD FOR YOU!!!! Thank you for asking after me. It will be ten years on April 9th. I have been dealing with some depression (more than usual), which I atttribute to mostly my symptoms, as well as some other stress going on for me right now. I have been giving in to being teary more, which is something I usually don't do, but lately it's providing me the relief I need to expell so much emotion. For me, that's a sign that my endurance and tolerance is low, and my stress level is high. I always try to look at my blessings rather than my struggles, but lately my depression and sadness has been a bit overwhelming and although I am still thankful for so many things, I have been mourning and missing the \"old\" (pre symptoms) me. You would think after this long I would be more even emotionally about my symptoms, but there is always some reminder of something I can no longer do or having to deal with the anxieties that come with feeling so awkward and out of sorts. I do feel sometimes that life as I would like it to be is passing me by, and since I only have one life and there is only one me, I should be celebrating or try to be celebrating more - but. So sometimes my emotions rise and fall, and after I peak, I come back down and bounce back. I am slowing bouncing back, again. I know I am not the only one to feel like this, but sometimes I FEEL as if I am. Especially since I've had my symptoms for so long. Thanks again for the well wishes! Can't wait to hear about MORE driving from you. xo "}, "4": {"a": "10032", "t": "Tess, You think you're moaning?! Lately, I feel like I am quite the downer on these boards and the BIGGEST moaner. I fear other posters are going \"oh no, ANOTHER depressed thread from Wowwwweeee\". <smiling as I type that>. I cannot count the times I have had to cancel or decline even the simplest of social events because of my symptoms - so I know how you feel about having to stay home. For me, that did get easier as I coped and adjusted better. You're right, it is about time, and your time will come where you are able to do what you what even if you still continue to have some limitations on some level for some reason! For me, I'm too stubborn NOT to keep trying to do that things I want to, within reason of course: I would really love to go to an amusement park and ride the Tilt-A-Whirl. It used to be one of my all-time favorite rides - come to think of it, ANY ride that spun me around when I would get that little thrill of adrenaline in my stomach used to be so much fun for me! Now I'm strictly a cotton candy girl instead of a ride girl when I go. I also feel that my life is all about my symptoms. It's a consideration in everything I do or want to do or cannot do. So! But so many people deal with so much more challenging and depressing issues - I am so lucky in so many ways. So as long as no-one shuts me down on here for being TOO depressing or TOO much of a moaner, I will probably continue to jump between some highs and lows on occasion. Okay, onto something fun (can't end EVERY post on a sad note): I live near a historical park, so every day on my way to and from work I drive through the park. It's a partcularly pretty time of the year, because the snows lays on the trees covering all the branches and you can see deep into the parks' forest. And there is a herd of deer that live there (I live on an old apple orchard, so we get a lot of deer also) - anyway, during the winter months, if you take your time driving through, you can actually see the deer lying in holes they have dug in the snow - sometimes alone, sometimes in groups. It's really something to see if you're a nature lover. So my goal (ever since I noticed them) is to get some good pictures of them all lying together. So every day for the past week, I have been taking the digital camera to and from work, and if I see them, I will pull over to the side of the road and try to capture them on film. Someone is going to see me and think I am a stalker because I am pulling over to the same spot either at 7 AM or at 5 PM every day. So far, the pictures I've taken are nothing to publish (ha ha), but it sure has been fun trying to take them. Drive well. Hugs. xo "}, "5": {"a": "10032", "t": "Spikey, I found that dealing with the anxiety was half the battle of dealing with my other symptoms. It had a pretty tight hold on me and impacted everything I did. What started out as a seemingly reaction to my head symptoms, rippled out into all areas of my life. I am anxious now ONLY because of my symptoms. Either due to my symptoms, or anticipating them increasing or changing. I used to not do much just because of the \"what if\" anxiety thoughts, but that no longer has a hold on me. I will usually do what I want to (within reason of course) even if I am anxious about it. My motto is it can't hurt to try, even if I am afraid. I am dealing with so much stress right now, that that does impact my anxiety level. I realize this about me and know my triggers for symptoms, so I am careful to keep a watchful eye on this - and when I am under more then usual stress, then I know my defenses and tolerance will be lower, which results in me not coping as best as I know I am able to. And of course, not coping as well doesn't just affect my symptoms - this intolerance trickles into all areas of my life so I feel as if I am continuing to spiral on a low streak. But I always bounce back. I completely agree with your statement of, \" \". At first it was hard to tell which is which! I had that trouble initially, and things became easier when I realized this, also. xo "}, "6": {"a": "10032", "t": "Nice driving Tesss!!! So, the MD said he can't help you with your GERD? Am I assuming that correctly? I do not take any medication for anxiety, although at one point I was so limited by my fears that it was highly suggested. My counselor at the time explained to me that medication to treat anxiety can be a good thing in short doses to help people get over the \"hump\", but treating anxiety needs to come from within a person, and eventually they need to learn how to deal and cope rather than depend on something pharmacological to get them through. So, I opted to 'do the work' right from the start in working to get over my anxiety without a medication. I think working on my anxiety issues will be a lifelong process for me, as I have always been an anxious person. However, I am far removed from the anxiety-ridden person I was so long ago when my symptoms first started. And Tesss, it was WORK. I had many start and stops, and spent many frustrated days (and nights) learning to trust myself and my body and to realize that I had all the tools inside of me to get past the anxious moments. Also, I was having full blown panic attacks, so I was very scared of the symptoms I was experiencing due to the intense adrenaline release in my body every time I had a panic attack. I had to wean myself off from thinking those frantic \"what if\" thoughts, and stop monitoring my body for tell-tale panic symptoms. I decided to look upon my anxiety issues as a personal challenge for me to overcome, and stopped looking at my progress as failure because it was in baby steps. There are a few things that helped me get back in the car: Yes, I have said this many times - for people dealing with an impacting illness or condition, they incur a deeper knowledge of themselves than most other people who don't need to call upon such inner strength to get them through. In some ways, I feel that experiencing something so life changing, for me, has made me a better person. I've overcome limiting anxiety, learned that I am healthy, realize I am very loved and accepted, know that I am capable of pushing myself even when I think I have no more to give, have become more compassionate to other people, and have been humbled like no other lesson has taught me. I know that I am luckier than others, who are confined to wheelchair or bed, who need assistance to breathe or eat. I have learned to appreciate the little things that people often take for granted (although I always was a lover of the little things), and generally have become a nicer person overall. I can still smile. And my experiences are helping someone else overcome a rough moment because I can say \"I have been there and back, and you will too\". xo "}, "7": {"a": "10032", "t": ", Ack - I used to really work myself up when my \"safe\" people weren't around, and that included if I went to work and my safe people weren't home waiting in case I would have to call. That was a difficult part of my anxiety to deal with - being around and coping MYSELF. But I realized that I was depending on these people to MAKE me feel better or GET me through the anxious moments, and that meant that I wasn't doing the work myself. And I realized that depending on others wasn't really resolving anything for me because I was still having panick attacks and anxiety in between running to someone else for support So, I simply started telling my supports to \"go on out\" without me (so I could practice being alone again), and I stopped calling so much when I felt panicked at work (so I could practice calming myself down instead of having someone talk me through). It was hard, because I so depended on the confidence and assurance of others, rather than on my own confidence and assurance. So I can understand how you must be feeling that your boyfriend isn't available to sit with you in the car - but use that as a good practice opportunity, even if you only go around the block a few times or opt for a shorter practice drive somewhere else. The thing that I knew I had to overcome was the feeling that I could drive (or whatever) on my own without a safety crutch (person), even if being alone and driving alone was emotionally and physically now uncomfortable for me. It's so much easier to do things if you're uncomfortable (physically or emotionally) when you know there's someone RIGHT THERE to help you or support you if you need it, I know. So, I just had to do it. Cold turkey, in baby steps. Baby cold turkey steps. So that meant saying things like, \"no, I'll go to the store by myself\", and \"sure, I'll be fine to stay home and shower (or whatever) while you go to the movies\". My safety people got so used to having to be there for me, that it probably was as hard on them to start leaving me alone as it was for me to tell them to go. So, continue to practice and empower yourself by allowing yourself some freedom or distance from your safe people. Small steps! But practice it. Glad you're going for some more tests - I am blessed to have a supportive doctor who will refer me to specialists whenever I ask. He sometimes doesn't know what to do about my head symptoms, but has told me that he will send me to a balance center outside NY State if I want. I'm sure he would even send me to the UK to see LL if I asked. My period is due in a few days, and my symptoms are always worse the week before, so today I dealing with increased symptoms that are causing me to feel unsettled. I'm still doing the things that I want to today, but it's uncomfortable. Ha, where else can you announce to the world that you're getting your monthly? It's strange how something so personal becomes a part of the conversation when talking about head symptoms. Now, get out there and have a drive! I'm going to go look for deer. , My symptoms are pretty much with me when I drive, and the worst for me is having to stop or wait at traffic lights. That causes me to notice my symptoms more, and then the drive can be more anxiety-provoking once I start to feel unsettled. But I can got for a whole weekend and not drive, and then start on Monday for work, and be fine with that. I have found however, that emotionally/psychologically, it's better for me to drive, even when I don't have to, to remind myself that I am able to (if that makes sense). As I mentioned in an earlier posting here, I have to make sure that I don't get \"lazy\" or start to reply too much on others or postpone driving because of my symptoms. Lately, being a passenger is bothersome, so I tend to \"have enough\" if I am out with someone and they are driving - after about 40 minutes. Although I love being chauffered around, lately I prefer to be the driver. Wishing everyone a nice day. It's cold, but sunny out! xo "}, "8": {"a": "10032", "t": "Hi Tesss, So, did you end the weekend with a longer drive? Good for you for venturing out without your b/f, AND for taking a bus to go shopping! Hope you bought something great! Saturday night a few of the girls got together and cooked dinner. One of my friends offered to come and pick me up and drive me home afterwards, but I took my own car. Saturday morning I was up early to look for more deer and then do some grocery shopping for the upcoming work week. Even though we still have snow on the ground, the flowers are starting to come up. Poor things, we usually get one more good snow before the end of March, so the flowers are usually frozen in time for a while. Sadly, NO deer in the park, but in the field behind where I work, there were three of them, so I got (finally) some good shots! Hope things are well for you this morning. I am dealing with being pretty symptomatic this morning. Blech. xo "}, "9": {"a": "10032", "t": "Good Morning Tesss and all, I know what you mean about thinking you can jump right back. I think that EVERY TIME my symptoms simmer to a more tolerable level, and then I go jumping around until I realize, \"uh oh, better not do THAT\". My symptoms were really noticeable at work all day yesterday, but by the time I got home, they started to ease up. I believe that my symptoms escalate sometimes at work (or whatever) based upon the amount of stress or anxiety I perceive or feel about that situation at times. Work is VERY stressful for me lately. I'm going to work today, AFTER my 8 AM job interview. Although I know that a new job would be a stressor for me JUST because of my symptoms and what I have to deal with, I have made a decision to look for other employment after 8 years. The current company that I work for has been through a few years of lay-offs (with the most recent being in January 2005), and we haven't had raises or bonuses in a few years. I still stayed because it was a good fit for me since it was close to home, quick access to many places that I could take care of errands on a lunch hour, and I am very familiar with the job and the responsibilities. Plus people at work know about my head symptoms, so I have a lot of support. But lately the dynamics of the company have changed, and I feel that everyone is just trying to keep a paycheck and trying to keep their own heads above the water (so to speak). My new supervisor (my old one got another job) is not a very good boss for his position, and it shows in how he treats others, and looks are certain aspects of the job and the team. He's not a bad guy, but just not really cut out for this position, which impacts me (I am his assistant). So there have neen considerations why it would be good to stay, and good reasons to look for something else. I am taking Option B. I usually enjoy starting a new job, and find good challenge in the newness and jitters of starting another position - but now my symptoms are a consideration. I have made one job change since my symptoms, and the first year here was rough for me symptom-wise. But I am positive it will work out anyway. So yes, continue to \"move your muscles\" by doing the things that make you hesitant. Driving is a very good place to practice since you know you are impacted in this area. Will check back after I get to work later. xo "}, "10": {"a": "10032", "t": "Hey Tesss, Don't worry AT ALL on the days that you don't want to push the driving thing. As you start to either compensate, adjust, or become less fearful of your symptoms, you definitely will start doing more things, and that includes driving and going out more on the weekends. For people with MAV, since symptoms can fluctuate, their symptoms can also - meaning that a person dealing with MAV may have great days, and other days as well. True, things like stress can trigger MAV symptoms more, but since MAV is a , it happens whether you have stress (for example) or not, so even if a person is not stressed out, they still can have spasming of the arteries, leading to increased symptoms. And don't forget (really, how could you), that even if you're not feeling particularly outwardly stressed, you are dealing with work, driving issues, having to deal with your symptoms, knowing you're limited in doing things, and all the effort put forth to fit in a normal day despite how you're feeling. THAT'S stress too. And remember that you are dealing with your symptoms AND some anxiety, so things may take a little longer for you to feel comfortable doing, like getting back in the car just to zip around. I'm glad you have the attitude of being in the right direction; it seems that way to me too, when I read your posts. You are very upbeat and positive, and that's sometimes very hard to maintain in the face of such a personal struggle, but so helpful if you can. Good for you! This morning went very well - out of all the positions I've looked into, it's only the third one that I feel that would be a golden opportunity for me. So, we'll see. It's tough out there right now for everyone, so I try not to put all my eggs in one basket, but this one would be VERY NICE. Ha ha, the hall was LONGER than the one at work I walk down now. SAME tiled floor. I just can't get away from it. lol But yes, I am going to go for this if given the chance. I WANT IT. Hugs to you and to all! xo "}, "11": {"a": "10032", "t": "Hey Tesss! Yes, by all means, don't feel you need to drive or do everything EVERY day. Sometimes working up to something is a process when you've got a woozy head. But it sounds like you're really doing wonderfully, and that's something to be very proud of! It's funny that you mention options for treating MAV because I've been on the phone for a good part of the day talking to some of the MDs that I've seen or want to see about treating my symptoms. Yes, for some people MAV can be maintained with the \"usual\" migraine treatments - diet and medication. Tesss, I am so scared to try anything in terms of medications or therapy. I treid taking a medication a few years ago, which worked GREAT, but the side-effect for me was a problem swallowing, and that was VERY upsetting for me. It took me months to finally opt to take the medication, had major anxiety attacks while on it because of my fears about medications, and then even though it worked like a charm, needed to go off it. Haven't tried anything since. But my symptoms are so overwhelming lately that I feel that I need to do something, and it looks like medication is the way to go for me. Now it's a matter of deciding to try the same one but on a lower dose, or something completely different. I cannot believe how stressed I am over this-whole-thing. Add to that the stress of employment searching and not liking my current job...well, YOU KNOW!! As for trigger foods, I know that if I ingest anything with a lot of additional refined sugar (like chocolate cake or iced tea mix), my symptoms increase. The same for anything with MSG or Aspertame. Otherwise, I don't notice much of an impact consciously on what I eat. I've heard that some people with MAV are impacted by drinking tea, but I love hot tea and this doesn't seem to affect me (thankfully so). So glad you are feeling so good about your accomplishments. I will be making a decision on medication probably within the next week. Thinking of you, and wishing everyone well. xo "}, "12": {"a": "10032", "t": "Tesss?

But I am taking care of it by making the decision to try something, despite my fear. I'm so happy to hear that you had a great day off. Shopping is always a plus! I also get shaky if my symptoms escalate. It's not the same kind of shaking that I would have if I was nervous or shivering - I attribute it to my body's reaction to feeling so unbalanced. It's definitely a scary feeling. I also feel edgy in the car, and find it difficult to sometimes look at things outside of the car window, moving or still. I'm glad you were able to get past it and drive home. I hope you both some great, fun things! This weekend so far has been a drag for me, but I ended up going out to a huge grocery store for a little while. It was unplanned, and I have been feeling so crappy with my symptoms and depression that I just said \"the heck with it\" and went along. I walked very slowly because I was nervous that I would be symptomatic, but it was okay.

But it sounds like you're doing what you need to do right now to get to work. I get fed up MANY times, so I know how you feel. It's difficult some times to remain upbeat and positive on the really frustrating times, I know. How lucky for that one sole who was able to get back on track after an inner ear infection. Yes, we DO wish it would be that easy for the rest of us. I'm also not feeling my perky best - the headaches lately have been DAILY and ONGOING - not fun and just makes my wooziness so much more noticeable. But I ended up having a nice end to my weekend (if not a rough start). I was able to get out and get some fabulous pictures of some deer this weekend. We came upon a bunch of them unexpectedly while driving through the park (about 8 or 10 of them). It was fun trying to sneak up on them to get pictures. Sunday was the best day. My symptoms had eased up a little, so I was able to enjoy my day a little more. But today back at work, a killer headache and that feeling of leaning the the right is driving me crazy. I have to walk up to the front office shortly and I am not looking forward to that. I am all dressed up today, and wearing my WORK BOOTS so I can balance. What a picture that makes! I have another interview tomorrow morning and then another one on Wednesday evening. Not looking forward to starting a new job which such a horrible head, but as I mentioned, a change of jobs may alleviate some stress, which may alleviate some symptoms. What a cycle! You've GOT to moan sometimes! You are just as deserving as a good cry as the next person, no matter how your symptoms compare. I have been moaning TOO much lately, and sometimes that only makes me feel worse. Okay, my turn for a joke: A man was driving down the road with twenty penguins in the back seat. The police stop him and say that he can't drive around with the penguins in the car and should take them to the zoo. The man agrees and drives off. The next day the same man is driving down the road with twenty penguins in the back and again. He is stopped by the same police officer who says, \"Hey!

I'm glad you're feeling happier and your symptoms were not so noticeable. I'm feeling better today, but my symptoms are lurking. Last night I got my back slathered up with Ben Gay and then sat back on a heating pad - I moved the heating pad to the top of my head for a while, and then went to bed after a few tv shows. I woke up feeling better than I have in weeks, which was nice. So my job interview was pretty good because I wasn't dealing with a woozy head (thanks for asking). I hate saying anything that might jinx me (lol), but I believe I have the job. I have one other interview tomorrow evening, and I am waiting on a call back from another job position that I am \"in the running\" for - so we'll see. But this one (today) may be the one for me. I actually felt so comfortable in the interview that I told him about my woozy head symptoms and the limitations that sometimes come with that, so that he knows I have a consideration in the work place. He was absolutely accepting of that, and told me they would work around that. I am still feeling a little unbelieving about that. Actually, good anxiety is STILL anxiety, and I have been dealing with feeling slightly anxious all day as a result of such a good interview (if that makes sense). Holy crow Tesss. But as the afternoon here at work goes on, I've had to take aspirin and some antihistamine because I'm rocking and swinging (pendulumn) a lot right now. And the headache is back ladies and gentlemen! My brother takes digestive enyzmes with each meal. He explained to me that these enzymes are the same ones found in the body, so there should be no side-effects. You may want to ask your pharmacist? Not sure if it depends on the brand you're taking. I have read a few other posts on here relating to stomach upset, etc. and the possible correlation to head symptoms. For me, I think that I have acid stomach on occasion because of all the stress I deal with - more stress adds to stomach problems. I also notice that if I have to (gee, how to I say this gracefully) have a bowel movement, that if I wait too long or have an upset stomach, I will start to feel fainty or lightheaded. I never used to feel that way before. It almost feels like the start of low blood sugar (a little nausea, sweaty palms, a generalized feeling of not feeling too well). But then I use the potty and the symptoms go away. Not sure if it's related to my head symptoms or not. My symptoms are usually with me on some level. but some things that set it off or add to them DURING A ROUTINE DAY, would be anxiety or stress (like planning a lunch outing with co-workers), having a headache that I don't treat with aspirin, walking down the hallways at work, being on the computer too long (certain screens throw me off), wearing my headset a lot at work, driving, not eating when I'm hungry. I also look for things that are \"causing\" my symptoms more, or when they go away, trying to figure out why they tapered down. It's frustrating to just not know! But you know that! If we knew, we could prevent it! Wishing you a GREAT DAY Tesss! Hugs! xo "}, "16": {"a": "10032", "t": "Hey Tesss, Just zooming to to wish you a good day and to say that I hope things are okay today.

I am finalizing out some details, so we'll see. I have another jon interview after work tonight, but I am already leaning to the OTHER one (above). Hope your day is going well for you. Hugs! xo "}, "17": {"a": "10032", "t": "Happy Easter Tesss, Lucky you to have a four day Holiday weekend! I took yesterday and this afternoon off, so I'm having an early start to my Easter also. Safe travels, and post soon. xo "}, "18": {"a": "10032", "t": "Hey Tesss, Glad to hear your Easter weekend was a nice one. Our family had a good one also. I colored Easter eggs - haven't done that in a while! Glad you're still driving. You'll be driving cross country soon! LOL Yes, my current office is all packed up. It's so BARE now! But I am excited to move forward and start something brand new. My last day here is April 5th, and I start my new job on April 11th. Woo-hoo!!!! And yes, I am going to focus on my new job right now and back-burner my symptoms. But I know that I have some options to pursue. It's just a matter of deciding what medication I should trial at this point. I am hoping that as I remove myself from this work place, my stress level will decrease, and so will my symptoms. Of course, starting a new job will bring new stress, but I am hoping it will be tolerable. I am not a good passenger in the car lately. I used to prefer being driven, but now my symptoms have changed, so I feel better driving. I can understand how the drive would have been uncomfortable for you. Good for you for sticking with it though. Over the past few months I've gotten in the car as a passenger for an event and think, just get me out of here! A few times we've had to pull over so I can drive! I also am not the best lately as a passenger in the back seat (where I usually would sit), so I have been in the front. I'm planning a vacation to North Carolina in early May. Trains are an automatic out for me (the swaying would bother me). So we are thinking of driving or flying. Driving as I mentioned has been uncomfortable lately, and that would mean at least two days in the car. Flying.....not sure yet. When I flew to Las Vegas last May, that was very uncomfortable. Hm. When you say \"lifts\", I am assuming you mean elevators. For the most part, I do not tolerate them well AT ALL, and the sensation causes me great physical discomfort and increases my symptoms. I avoid them the majority of the time. Depending on the elevator, I can tolerate some quick travels as long as the length of the ride is short and depending on what type of elevator it is. I have found the the newer ones are less noticeable in terms of the sensation of going up and back down, and the smoother the ride, the easier it is. The \"up-n-down\" motion inside my head after the elevator stops is VERY bothersome, and after I get off, I need to sit down or walk in bare feet down the hall to get my feet and body back accustomed to walking on the floor. So as a general rule, I take stairs. This also applies to escalators and tread mills. Same type of thing. I think it has to do with \"imprinting\", meaning that it's normal for most people to still feel like they are walking on a tread mill for a short while after they get off of it, but for me, this sensation stays with me on a very impacting level. I had to stop drinking alcohol since I've had these symptoms. Alcohol just increases the feeling of imbalance and the \"fish bowl\" effect for me. I miss it some times, because I love a good Long Island Iced Tea or a glass of Plum Wine - but not enough to go back to having a drink. Over the years, I thikn I've had maybe a total of one full glass of alcohol. But I refrain. It doesn't bother me - even if I go out with friends and everyone is drinking except for me. But boy, a nice cold glass of Asti would hit the spot! Big Hug! xo "}, "19": {"a": "10032", "t": "Hey Tesss, Remember, you will have very frustrating days, especially with the driving, since you are sensitive to that from an anxiety standpoint. You WILL have better days, but it takes time, pratice and patience. As your symptoms subside and/or you become more acclimated to how you feel with your symptoms, you will be able to do more. My guess here is that you are definitely experiencing symptoms while driving - even the little ones - like feeling slightly off when in the car - so that adds to your anxiety, and the combination is causing you to feel all the funky symptoms you did (weird and shaky). I get that bizarre shaky feeling also, and I don't think it's related to the kind of shaking a person feels after a scary incident. It feels like I am unable to control it, and it's more of an internal shake than a stomach trembling shake (like when you're nervous). I think that THAT kind of shaking has something more to do with the body's reaction to feeling physically off-balance. It's something that I can't calm down myself - it simply has to run it's course. It's more like a stiff shaky feeling - like I am walking but doing it very awkwardly and stiffly and my legs are moving, but more like Frankenstein, if that makes sense. One thing that may help you during an anxious moment in the car is trying to take some of the focus off the moment. For me, I keep a bottle of something to drink with me - usually water, Gatorade (high in sodium) or iced tea (sugar). The act of opening the bottle and taking a few swallows helps me shift focus, allows myself to take a moment to do something that I am in control of, and lets me regroup. Salt sometimes is beneficial for people who deal with low blood pressure issues, and sugar is sometimes beneficial for people who deal with low blood sugar issues. A little sugar also acts as a temporary calming aide - so keep a lollipop handy or a bite of chocolate. Or chew gum. Doing something like that is a \"quiet\" way to keep busy, and allows you to focus on something other than your head symptoms. And you don't need to stop what you're doing to take a swallow or lick a lollipop. Plus, sometimes with my head symptoms I don't feel \"grounded\", so holding onto a water bottle (for example) is another way to help me keep my balance in public when I need a little extra something to make me feel \"solid\". Glad you're doing well otherwise. Please keep us informed about your other testing. You're right, a few us of have important things coming up all on the same day! Kismit! xo "}, "20": {"a": "10032", "t": "Hey Tesss, Glad you are feeling supported by me - you are just as supportive and encouraging! Good for you for just making the decision to let time and compensation do it's thing. It's definitely will be one less thing for you to stress about. You seem very motivated and grounded, so just try to maintain that attitude, especially during the rougher moments when it's not so easy to remain upbeat. You'll do just fine, I can tell. I don't think sugar prevents the vertigo from happening, but I have read that a little sugar boost can help alleviate internal anxiety temporarily. So, it may help you calm down from an anxiety-standpoint. Just don't go eating TOO much sugary stuff or you will gain weight. LOL Thanks for asking after me. I have been nearly symptom-free for three days, with the exception of this afternoon, when I have started to feel a little symptomatic again. I am VERY thankful for those three incredible days. I have been out shopping after work and enjoyed a few walks with my dog. It's been heaven and I have been very happy. I will expect jitters probably the weekend before I start my new job. Mixed with a little insomnia from stress - so it should be interesting. I do better with structure - so it probably would be to my advantage to leave this job and immediately start my new one, but I know that if I can just relax a little more, I will enjoy the days off in between. We will see! It sounds like you're in good spirits despite feeling a little \"off\" today - good for you! BIG HUG! xo "}, "21": {"a": "10032", "t": "You're right - new thread!!!!

More and more regular grocery stores are also starting to carry gluten-free products as well. One thing to keep in mind is that gluten-free products tend to be higher in calories and considerably higher in cost than the regular product. I've decided to use them as a special treat, rather than as the basis for my diet. My diet will continue to consist mostly of rice, lots and lots of veggies, chicken and fish, the occasional piece of red meat or pork, fruit, nuts and seeds, raw milk products, and the occasional egg.

And some people who don't have the genes do develop Celiac. They also haven't found all the genes that indicate Celiac yet. There's still a lot of research to still be done. I've also had the small bowel biopsy done. It came back negative, but he only took two samples when they're supposed to take 4-6 samples. The problem with the biopsy is that only 30% of people who have tested positive on the blood tests will also have positive biopsy results. From what I've been reading, if taking gluten out of your diet makes you feel better, then that's the only indicator you really need. Something else to consider - having an official dx of Celiac can make it more difficult to get health and life insurance further down the road. For that reason alone, many people (after either dropping gluten from their diets or having a positive reaction on elimination diet/challenges) consider themselves to be self-dx'd Celiacs, rather than pushing for an official dx.

There are a couple of things you should think about. The first is whether you have acid reflux (heartburn, post nasal drip, lump in throat feeling). Acid reflux can cause asthma-like symptoms and can make sinusitis symptoms worse. Typically it can be treated with over-the-counter medications (the best one available without a prescription is Omeprazole which I believe is called Losec in the U.K.). If you have acid reflux you need to get it under control or the symptoms won't improve The same is true of allergies, you have to get the underlying cause of your sinus/asthma symptoms under control and the best way to manage allergies is with daily antihistamines. For the sinus symptoms there are some additional things you can do. The first is regular sinus irrigation with a neti pot or SinusRinse bottle - it will help get any thickened mucus out of your sinus cavities and will soothe some of the irritation. Many people with chronic sinus problems irrigate 2-3 times a day (morning, noon, night) and find it helps tremendously. You might also try a steroid nasal spray - something like Flonase or Rhinocort. You'll need a prescription but they also help with the nasal inflammation. The best way to manage this stuff is to get on a daily regimen of medications to control the underlying causes and irrigation to help keep your sinuses healthy. "}, "1": {"a": "6613", "t": "I'm a bit confused about your latest post. Are you saying that you've tried irrigation when you were having symptoms (discolored drainage) and nothing came out when you irrigated but the discolored drainage was still showing up on your pillow in the morning? I also noticed that you mention that you may not have used the antihistamines and irrigation long enough, which makes me wonder if you're misunderstanding the context of all of this. Asthma and sinusitis are both inflammatory problems but there are two \"levels\" of symptoms that most of us \"sufferers\" deal with, chronic and acute. Acute sinusitis and asthma attacks are flare ups caused by infections, allergens, that cause inflammation to get out of control. Typically the acute flare ups require antibiotics, oral steroids or higher doses of other meds for a couple of weeks to get them under control. It's impossible to avoid the acute flare ups and we're just trying to avoid them as much as possible (and know to call the doctor right away when they happen). The chronic symptoms have to be \"managed\" with medications like antihistamines, steroid nasal sprays and asthma inhalers, and with other treatments like saline irrigation. The goal of all of these every day things is to minimize the inflammation in the lungs and sinuses to keep them functioning correctly (and help ward off acute infections). Antihistamines start to work very quickly but they only work for 24 hours (at the most) and must be taken every day (at least during allergy season) if they're going to help. All it takes is one allergy attack and your sinuses get inflamed and infected. Saline irrigation should be done every day to keep mucus from clogging your sinuses (maybe several times a day if you're having symptoms). You may also want to try a nasal steroid spray like Rhinocort (but again, it needs to be take every day to be effective). Most asthma medications also need to be taken every day to manage the inflammation. The whole goal of daily maintenance is to minimize inflammation and help avoid the infections, but it only helps if you use the preventative and maintenance treatments every day. "}, "2": {"a": "6613", "t": "The nose and lungs are pretty closely linked so the stuff that's going on with your nose could definitely be affecting your chest (or vice-versa). And, it's very common for people who have issues with one to have problems with the other because most sinus and respiratory issues are inflammation-related and the whole respiratory tract can get inflamed if one part is irritated. That's why the maintenance regimen is so important - once the inflammation starts it's much harder to control your symptoms. If you're having asthma symptoms but aren't convinced you have asthma, the other likely culprit (that can also cause sinus inflammation) is acid reflux. It commonly causes asthma-like symptoms (wheezing, chest tightness, etc) by irritating the lining of the esophagus, and that irritation can even spread to the sinuses. I guess that's one more thing to try to get under control to see if it helps with your overall symptoms.

I originally took 20 mg once a day, but eventually could get by taking half of that (10 mg) every day. I had total acid suppression on 10 mg (I cut the pill in half because the Aciphex was so expensive and I had to pay it out of pocket. But the 10 mg worked like a charm. I could eat and drink anything I desired whenever I desired. Then, I went off Aciphex about two years ago and stayed off for about two years (I have written extensively about this on another thread but the long and short of it is that I developed osteopenia or the precursor to osteoporosis while on the Aciphex). I made changes in my diet, took Zantac, and was never symptom free for two years, but I managed. Then, about six weeks ago I began to experience heartburn and a sore throat that lasted pretty much all day no matter what I did. After about two weeks of not being able to get it back under control, I called my family care doctor and obtained a new prescription of Aciphex. I took the 20 mg dutifully for a week and nothing. I made an appt. with the gastroenterologist (I have an endoscopy scheduled for tomorrow) and she doubled the Aciphex, which still did nothing for another week. I called them back last week and she switched me to Protonix 40 mg twice a day. I did not tolerate the Protonix too well. Besides giving me an awful burning sensation in my stomach, I felt hot all day as if I were experiencing hot flashes. Right now I am taking over the counter Prevacid once in the morning and a Zantac at night before dinner. My symptoms are better, but I still have periods of heartburn if I eat anything dairy (I used to have a yogurt in the morning with breakfast) or too many carbs. I plan to talk to the gastroenterologist tomorrow before or after the endoscopy (this will be my second one) to discuss meds. So far the Prevacid seems to be working the best of the ones I have tried. Thank you for taking the time to reply. Rose "}, "10": {"a": "9827", "t": "I had my second upper endoscopy yesterday. The GI doctor said it all looked pretty normal on the surface, but she took biopsies (which is the common thing to do) and they have to be looked at by a pathologist to see if there are any abnormal cell changes or mutations. She gave me some pictures this time, and they are interesting to look at. To the naked eye it all looks like a pink tube and blobs of tissue. The procedure went well. I had no side effects so I now have to wait for results. My symptoms are now back under better control so long as I watch my diet very carefully. I still feel some heartburn after meals, but I chew gum and also have Carafate I can take here and there as needed. I am now taking two Prevacids a day plus Zantac as needed. I have tried Aciphex (which worked great the first time around) and Protonix (which gave me a horrible burning sensation the two days I took it). Prilosec OTC and Prevacid work somewhat. I have not tried Nexium yet, but that may be my next option if I continue to plateau on the Prevacid. Thank you for asking. Rose "}}}}
