If you wean slowly from Paxil or the Effexor you might experience some discomfort, but you will be alright. You can cross that bridge when you come to it, right now you need to feel better. Do some more research to give yourself more peace of mind, then let us know what you decide. My ob/gyn also prescribed the Wellbutrin and my internal med. dr. wanted me to try Effexor. Looking back I wish that I had tried the Effexor, it might have saved me a year or two of anguish. Don't you just love prekindergarteners? When I was feeling my worst they really did pick up my spirits with their candidness, abundance of love and hugs, boosting my ego by telling me how pretty I am (especially when I felt like poop) and how much they love me.

I loved lexapro! both for anxiety and pmdd....but I was really tired and did also eat more... I truly think because I felt better and was just more relaxed. I did have hives that I thought were from the lexapro, but I sitll get them on the zoloft, so it must just be plain old stress or my detergent, fabric softener, whatever. Back to your question, I am not on the effexor. I guess I stopped too quickly without giving it a chance. If the zoloft doesn't really kick in during the next few weeks, I'll have to decide whether to go back on lex or effexor. I had way more energy on the effexor and in reality, it probally would have worked had I stayed it with it and not read all the negative posts about it.

When I go to a movie theater, I always tell my husband I will meet him outside when the movie is done. I make a \"bee-line\" right to the doors before the crowd.

My father asked if I have always done this (I didn't even realize I was doing it!) . I had to walk the hospital stairs many times to relieve the restlesness. I did see a psychiatrist this past summer for my depression; hoping she would put me on the correct meds. It was the worst experience of my life and she was the rudest healthcare professional I have ever been to. She tried ONE med with me...... Cymbalta (obviously, her 'standard' choice). I am sensitive to meds and when I told her it wasn't working.....THAT WAS IT! The honest truth.....she gave up and would not try another. Needless to say, I was devastated and will remember that moment as being the lowest day in my life. That experience has \"tainted\" me and I'm afraid to even attempt to find another psychiatrist.

I tried one last week and I was still crawling out of my skin in the pew....legs were jumping and I could not sit still. Perhaps the dosage is too low (.25); or perhaps the fact that it is a generic brand? My gyn prescribed it quite some time ago (for anxiety), but I never used it then.

I feel like I have already lost enough time in my life to anxiety,and trying to decide what to do about it. One of my major problems with the anxiety was insomnia, and the klonopin works like a charm with me for sleep.

Also, I have six sons, so it seems like one of them always is up during the night for something, and I am not so zonked out by the klonopin that I can't wake up and help them with whatever they need. Really, I guess what I am trying to do as be as healthy as I can and cope with anxiety the best way I can. My main excercise is walking, but I also swim and try to do some aerobics, but I tend to have neck and shoulder tension from the anxiety and doing \"workout\" tapes tends to aggravate it, which in turn, keeps me awake at night...you can see the cycle going on there.

Best wishes, Marirose "}, "1": {"a": "3164", "t": "Hi Kelly, thanks for the input! I feel like I am my own worst enemy sometimes, also. I try to do some form of excercise everyday, and I am on a lowfat diet (not very strictly, but doing the best I can) and I do drink a lot of water - 2 1/2 - 3 liters a day (I think that is about 100 ounces, but I am terrible at math). I am a stay at home mom (what kind of job would I have to get to make a profit after day-care expenses for this tribe and what kind of day care would take them?? LOL!!!!!!!) so discipline is a big problem for me too. You mentioned you have a teenager - my oldest is about to be 12 - do you find yourself with excessive anxiety about your child or children? Sometimes I feel like I worry about them too much - I thought coping with sibling fighting and diaper rashes and colds with croup were bad! What do you experience as far as your own anxiety with a teenager? Hope you have a great day!

He is going to be the start of my teenage terror, I just know it! Anyway, just wanted to pass on a little info - I started a thread on excercise and fitness for advice on home based excercise programs - very interesting advice, you might want to check it out...

I don't have excessive worry over them, but this is a whole new phase with the teenage years. She'll be driving next year! She is a good kid, just a little sassy if you know what I mean. I'm sure things will get worse before they get better. We have our own set of issues and I tend to freak out pretty quickly over small things. I am working on that and hoping the meds will help. I have to agree that this is much, much harder than the diapers and croup when she was little. If your oldest is 12 and you have 5 sons behind him, I know you are so busy! I think the most important thing to do during these years is to know their friends and where they are. She is hardly ever home anymore, but I do trust the group she is with.

There may be another med they can give you for that problem. I had a lot of the same symptoms that you are describing. I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and referred to a psychiatrist. I was prescribed celexa (an anti-depressant that also works well to treat anxiety) and trazadone ( as a sleep aid). I've been on these for about 8 months with great success. I had some problems recentl with additional anxiety and more trouble sleeping so they doubled my dose of both and that seems to have helped.

My therapist cannot prescribe meds so they have to come thru my primary or an actual pyschiatrist. Mine come thru a psychiatrist because at the time I did not have a primary physician yet ( I had just switched insurance) but my primary would have been able to do prescribe it as well. I would look into that first and get started on some meds. It sounds like you have had bad luck with Wellbutrin and Lexapro... I originally asked my doc about Wellbutrin because I have a friend that is on it with great success...but she said that it did not treat anxiety as well as some of the other meds do so she did not want to use that one. EVen though you have had troubles with a couple, there are SOOO many depression/anxiety meds out there that could help you. It's just a matter of trial and error because each med is different for different people. I originally tried Zoloft several times years ago when I was still with my old doc. I always had TERRILE side effects from it, to the point that it made my problems worse and then I would just quit taking it. I don't know why they never tried a different med for me... That is why my doctor put me on Celexa this time. I was very nervous and hesitant to try any meds. I was in therapy for 4 montsh with them suggesting medication before I finally gave in and agreed to try a new medicine. Well, I wish I had done it sooner because it really, really, helped me! So, if it were me, I would set up an appointment with my primary and describe my problems and then tell them what meds did NOT work (the Wellbutrin and Lexapro for you). Whatever they prescribe, make sure that it works well for both depression AND anxiety. Also, ask them for a med to take at night to help you sleep. Part of your fatigue might mean that even though you are sleeping at night, you may not be getting \"quality\" sleep. And perhaps also a med such as Lorazapam or Alprazolam for times when you have more severe anxiety during the day and need something to help without knocking you out. THEN, I would ask my doctor for a referral to a good therapist. One that specializes in depression/anxiety. When I first started therapy I went every 2 weeks then dropped down to once a month.

In brief, I have had schizophrenia for the past 20 years when i was taking depixol injection. I have in that time been on several antipsychotics including abilify, zyprexa, seroquel etc and also several antidepressants in combination. I have had these so called fear attacks or what I term anxiety all that time. I also had the eye rolling which was called ocular gyrocrisis when in hospital which went away when i was put on the new antipsychotics. I can't say with certainty whether it is medication induced or not as you may well know if I stop my current meds (resperidol, amisulpiriide, paroxetine and amitryptyline) then you risk getting ill and being sectioned.

HTH "}, "2": {"a": "6111", "t": "From what I have read on the net there are two versions lets say of akathesia - and the one that I feel i have more of is the subjective akasthesia whereby you experience anxiety etc. Good luck with your appointment on the 2 Sept. I don't want to distract you because I find with this particular illness the person has to learn from personal experience but I tried a whole host of different antipsychotics - zuclopenthixol, sulpiride, amisulpiride, chlorpromazine, risperidone, abilify, seroquel, zyprexa and I still got this \"fear\". It could be that the other drugs had not got out of my system in time. The eye rolling - ocular gyric crisis - only happened once to me in a hospital setting but now in the community i still for many years had so called pseudo-ocular gyric crises whereby the mere thought of having another one drove me to a mini eye rolling event. I say HAD as I don't fear them anymore and I believe with some self belief I hope you will stop having them as well. I agree with your statement that anticholinergic drugs help and they did for me too including procyclidine but my doctor believed that I was using them for their mood altering properties rather than treating the residual anxiety I had as a result of being diagnosed schizophrenic. I also tried another artane which I bought over the internet and foolishly took as it did help initially but I needed higher doses which in turn has their own side effects so I gave up. This where I had a mini breakthrough, I hope, whereby quite recently my doctor quite accidently prescribed me amitriptyline which is a tricyclic antidepressant for sleeping but I have been using it to get ride os this \"fear\". I believe it works by it mere anticholingeric effect - do some research on if you can.

Less common in sedating antipsychotics such as zuclopenthixol (Cisordinol) or chlorpromazine where anticholinergic and antihistaminergic effects counteract akathisia to a degree. SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac). [14] It has also been documented with the use of paroxetine (Paxil). [11] Akathisia has been studied as the mechanism by which SSRI-induced suicidality occurs. [14] Other antidepressants, such as venlafaxine (Effexor)[citation needed], the tricyclics and trazodone (Desyrel). Certain anti-emetic drugs, particularly the dopamine blockers, such as metoclopramide (Reglan), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and promethazine. Antihistamines, such as cyproheptadine or diphenhydramine. Opioid withdrawal. Barbiturates withdrawal. Cocaine withdrawal (Mostly in heavy and long-term users). Amphetamines[15] and any stimulant (even coffee and tobacco). Benzodiazepine, and alcohol. Chondromalacia patellae, resulting in discomfort when knees are bent. Serotonin syndrome.

They are the only meds that ever helped my anxiety unfortunately. I have tried all the major SSRI's and they have never helped me. The benzos did work for awhile but after years of use, tolerance sets in and starts making many ppl sick altho I have known a few lucky ppl who have been on the same benzo for over 30 years and they proclaim that the drug continues to work and help them. My feelings about benzos are now very mixed having gone thru 3 horrendous withdrawals over the past 20 years. The worse w/o a doubt was from the drug klonopin. It worked great for approx 8 or 9 years and then panic attacks and anxiety slowly started creeping back in. I knew I was in serious trouble when I tried to double, then triple my dose to no avail. I just could not get the drug to work anymore and it did not matter how much I took. It you ever reach tolerance on benzos, often you then have no option but to come off or switch to another benzo and pray it works. I spent a month in a psychiatric hospital and they gave me massive amounts of SSRI's, other psychotropics, and anti seizure meds but I had seizures anyway from the klonopin w/d. The mental and physical pain is unreal. You can't describe it justly with words IMO. I do not wish to scare anyone and benzos did help me for many years but now some 20 years later, my GABA receptors are just worn down from chronic administration of the drug over the years I think. I lost my job of 20 years and had to file for SSDI now b/c of all this. I don't mean to discourage anyone who takes these drugs and finds them helpful. I hope they will work for as long as you wish to continue to take them. I am just relating personally to what had happened to me over the years. I have a really severe case of anxiety and panic. I now do things like meditation and light exercise and control things the best I can, plus I still take some medication but it does not help much unfortunately anymore. Even many of the good years I spent on benzos, I would have periods of severe anxiety and panic that I have just had to endure. Drugs are a double edge sword IMO. There are some that can say on them for many years and do great but there are others where the drug or drugs often compound the problem in the end. If you are one of the lucky ones where the SSRI's alone are enough to control your anxiety and panic, this is a lot better IMO for longterm use than benzos.

They are a better longterm option for GAD/Panic IMO but they don't work well for many ppl with PD. I take lexapro and it helps a little I suppose but still have daily GAD and panic attacks even tho I am on this drug. It is really the only one I can tolerate but it does not help me much. I can't try going up on the dose because it makes me really sick on the stomach. If it was not for tolerance, benzos would be the perfect meds to take for a lifetime IMO. I still take valium PRN and a xanax here and there when the panic gets the better of me. I think by being in detox, you did get a kind of a reset. The same thing happened to me but the problem is you will build tolerance again quickly and have to go thru the same painful process over. I have had 3 bad w/d's from benzos. I don't think my body can tolerate another one....too old now. I also think I have worn my GABA receptors down. Even when I take a benzo PRN, I am only getting 20-30% relief.

Here is a description on Xanax/Alprazolam (also has different names) What is alprazolam? Alprazolam is in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines. Alprazolam affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause anxiety. Alprazolam is used to relieve anxiety, nervousness, and tension associated with anxiety disorders. Alprazolam is also used to treat panic disorders. Alprazolam may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. I take both on occasion. The only way I can explain the difference, is that the Xanax can be taken during the day, and it helps calm the nerves, and relaxes me, while the Ambien is to be used at bedtime, for obvious reasons, so you will fall asleep, which you wouldn't want to happen during the day I hope this helps there is a big difference between the two.

I'm so glad that you are beating the back pain, but it's too bad about the pain meds. But it seems you have the right idea. Yes, it sounds like you've developed an addiction to the pain meds and the Ambien. The anxiety you feel is part of withdrawal. There are a couple of ways to deal with withdrawal symptoms: usually people taper off on their medications. You will feel mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, inability to sleep etc.) for the entire period you are tapering off. It will be uncomfortable for a while, a week to 2 weeks, usually. But afterwards your body will be free of the acquired tolerance to these medications. You should consult a medical professional about how to do this. My dad took Ambien for a while when he couldn't sleep after the death of my mom. It was scary. He would sleepwalk. Once he called me up; his speech was slurred and he wasn't making any sense. I drove over to his house and found him passed out on the couch. When I came in he woke up. I tried to get him to go to bed, but he refused. He even tried to jump off his balcony (only one story up!) saying he wanted to commit suicide because he didn't want to live without my mom. I was terrified! I finally got him to go to bed and made him promise not to get up until the morning. I took the rest of his Ambien. In the morning he didn't remember any of this and asked for the Ambien back. Much later he admitted that he had \"sleepwalked\" several times on the Ambien, and stopped taking it. On a side note: Several years ago there was a great natural sleep aid available without a prescription. I forget the name, but it was apparently the natural substance your brain produces when it sleeps, so it was not even addictive. I have suffered from insomnia all my life, and this substance was the ONLY thing I have ever taken that produced natural sleep without a hangover the next day. For a few years I was free of insomnia, and never had one of those awful days at work where I had slept only 2 hours the night before! It seemed like a miracle. But, unfortunately, some people started using it as a knock-out drop by slipping it into other people's drinks, and it was made illegal. Now it's not even available by prescription. So now I'm back to having occasional sleepless nights. I won't take Ambien because I got so scared that night with my dad. Well, occasional insomnia is minor compared to back pain, and very different from chronic insomnia due to pain or other problems. If your pain is so severe that you can't sleep on a regular basis, it's worth taking Ambien or any sleeping aid just to get some rest. I'd say getting addicted to Ambien is a very small price to pay for a good night's sleep.

He addresses primarily benzos, but I believe it could also apply to any psychoactive substance. Here's the tidbit from the doctor's article: \"It is important not to confuse physical dependence as evidenced by benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes with addiction or drug dependence (DSM-IV). The majority of people suffering with prolonged withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines do not meet sufficient criteria to make the diagnosis of addiction. They are NOT addicts. Addiction is a biopsychosocial syndrome. Less than ten percent of the population is at risk. Although there are eight diagnostic criteria, three of which must be present for a year; the syndrome can best be described by \"the 3 Cs\". Control: when the addicted person starts using their drug they episodically lose control over their ingestion. Compulsion: getting and using the drug takes on more and more importance or salience in the person's life, crowding out relationships and activities that were once important to them. Consequences: they continue using the drug despite the drug causing problems at home, problems in relationships, medical problems, legal problems, emotional and psychiatric problems and finally vocational problems. Physical dependence is simply a neurobiological phenomenon due to continued exposure to a drug. It happens to all human brains exposed to drugs such as benzodiazepines and opioids. It is not addiction\". "}, "10": {"a": "5891", "t": "Howard, yes, the majority of benzo patients do not pass the addict test/criteria. And Stevie Nicks is still here. I told you it can be done.

I've lost posts before, so if I am typing a long one, I usually save it on notepad in my computer before trying to post it, in case something flips out I still have what I wrote and can try again. Your doc says klonopin is not addictive, but that's not true. Even Paxil is addictive; a lawsuit forced them to change the commercial because they used to say it's non-habit forming and people were going thru withdrawals after they stopped it. But again, it's the fine line between what is physical dependancy and what is true addiction that is played with when they claim non-addictive, non-habit forming...pure semantics. I don't currently take any drugs for anxiety, and I don't have anxiety now. The anxiety I once had was drug-related...prescribed drugs that is. Basically what happened to me is, a reaction to a codiene-based medication(prescribed for an illness) caused withdrawal symptoms, something I wasn't familiar with. I didn't go to the doctor much as I was very healthy; I had no experience with anything more than occassional antibiotics and OTC cold remedies. But when my doc retired, I saw a new one who gave me the codiene for a nasty bronchitis. After I stopped it, all my symptoms were classic narcotic withdrawals, although like I said, I didn't know it at the time. I only discovered it much later when I was prescribed benzos and found out their dangers...too late though, since I was already in tolerance withdrawals from Ativan. I went through hell...sleeping and eating was impossible. I was a wreck; couldn't sit still long but any mild activity took only 30 seconds to completely exhaust me and I had to sit down. Emotional ups and downs; rages and crying, breathing problems, etc. When I found out about the things these drugs can cause, at first I almost didn't believe it! I thought anyone who had trouble with these drugs surely must have abused the medicines; after all, doctors heal not hurt, right? So naive; that was me. But the more I read, I realized it was happening to me and it's happened to alot more people than the general public knows of. So if only one doctor would have admitted maybe I was perhaps given too much codiene, it would have saved me alot of suffering, because narcotics like codiene are not as brain-altering as benzos and the recovery from them is alot shorter. Instead they gave me benzos and I suffered through tolerance and then withdrawal and benzo protracted withdrawals for a long time. I am angry over the whole ordeal, but that isn't so bad when I realize I did learn something important which has since then helped others such as alot of friends and relatives...and hopefully some strangers out in cyberspace.

Tolerance is apparent when the regular dose does not work at all anymore and must be raised to work. Dependancy means your med dose is still effective, but if you try to quit, you will experience withdrawal symptoms, which are sometimes simular to original problems. However, the studies by people such as Prof. Ashton have shown that even people who took benzos for something like muscle spasms, ended up with anxiety, insomnia and other symptoms of withdrawal upon discontinuation of their benzo, sometimes for quite a long time! These were not previous conditons. The fact is, some people end up taking benzos forever because of withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation were thought to be original conditions returning...even if original cause of condition(such as anxiety over a new job) was no longer relevant, or original condition was not as severe as the withdrawal symptoms. Some former anxiety patients have reported that once their withdrawals ended, their original anxiety/sleep problems never came back. So most likely, the years spent on the drugs simply staved off withdrawals for those people. So, discontinuing a benzo is a guessing game of original vs. drug-withdrawal anxiety, but people like Prof. Ashton, who studied benzo users for around 20 years and ran a clinic for them, seems to think it's the latter. But ask any doctor today and they will 10 times out of 10 say it's original condition; a more easy, convienient, and profitable conclusion for them...

Many people had success with her tapering method but there are always exceptions.

Just be cautious, since sometimes people get frustrated and end up trying to withdraw too quickly, or end up raising doses too high to avoid withdrawal symptoms!

I personally did not resort to alcohol, although tempting....but since I wasn't a drinker to start with, I guess I figured why start...I mean seriously, I've tasted some drinks from family or friends but never really drank a whole one myself! I just never liked the taste of the stuff....to each his own I guess. As far as the issue of substituting alcohol for benzo, well, it's probably not a good idea. I wouldn't recommend it. However, it does astonish me that there are people out there who think drinking is just just soooooo awful ....yet think nothing of popping Xanax or taking benzos everyday of their life! .....these are both basically the same to the brain, except I think the pills are actually more potent. And more dangerous; especially since they are more accepted by people because they are given by a doctor instead of a bartender. But I know of one doctor who said benzos are \"alcohol in a pill\", and about 1 mg. Xanax=8 ounces pure gin! So what makes them better? I guess better for the pockets of the drug/medical professionals only. So certainly if benzos are to be accepted as an anxiety/panic treatment, alcohol is probably not any worse if taken in \"moderation\" and not \"abused\" (notice same arguement of the typical pro-benzo). So, if you say the only way you'll get off benzos is with alcohol's help, I wouldn't say that's all that horrible. The only problem is how much alcohol would help? And would you be in danger of future alcoholism? That's the stumper. So why not still taper as best as you can, at least intil you can get off fairly comfortable and then try other means to quell withdrawals....you know, chammomile tea, calcium, benedryl, tylenol, aspirin could also help...perhaps leave the alcohol as a last resort maybe.

Since Xanax has a shorter half-life you might need more frequent doses than the Klonopin as you cut down.

I think it's good to know the extreme side of such a thing as benzos, because more people have been there but don't even know it or why. Some simply suffer all their lives not even knowing they have a drug-related problem...you'd be surprised at the amount of people with on-going problems while on the drugs and/or withdrawals and they don't know it's the drug at all! Sometimes they never find out and continue their course, thinking they are suffering from this or that, but never knowing the drugs themselves and/or tolerance/withdrawal is causing it. Only the lucky ones like us find out and can stop it. But howard, I think although you have had it rough, you may be one to be able to get off without as many problems as some.

But please don't write off the site or Ashton as invalid, because you were not one to have as many difficulities.... after all, your dosage and time on wasn't too long so you are lucky. Instead, let the site educate/guide you but also at the same time, know everyone is different when it comes to dosages, type of benzo, detox, withdrawals, etc. Maybe someday you will meet someone who needs that information more than you did and you could pass it along... it can be invaluable for some people to know that extreme side of benzo land does exist and it's not all in their heads...... "}, "23": {"a": "5891", "t": "I am glad to hear you are doing so well! Yes, with any group, there are people with an inflexible point of view. I think even Prof. Ashton says everyone is different in the case of benzos....of course, there are obvious simularities to the benzo scenario but each case varies. There are whole groups of benzo sufferers who thrive on Valium tapers, whole groups who do not, just as certain symptoms are more severe in some people but not in others. I had a few of the symptoms, but never once suffered the infamous DP/ DR that alot of the group did! I had no idea so many got that symptom intil reading about their suffering. I thought at one point maybe it would pop up, but it never did. I think some benzos cause more insomnia, some cause other symptoms. They all share a certain pattern of symptoms but always varied. But it doesn't really matter what your chosen course of withdrawal is, you are winning the battle with benzos and that is really all that counts!

Perhaps the taper was a bit too fast. Taking more to calm withdrawals sets you back even more, so maybe the next cuts should be put off a bit and then very small. I know it's hard to slow up a taper when you want to be done with these things once and for all. But remember our friend the tortoise in that cute fable? I know it's hard to get off these pills, alot of people do not succeed and end up ill most of their lives from them or on a cocktail of other drugs. Some people get desperate and drink alot with them because alcohol makes them work better....this is where the addiction stigma happens to some people who's pills have stopped working, the doc won't give more, and they are in constant withdrawals even while on meds....they try to get the pills to work better with the alcohol, only this is really dangerous because the combo of pills and alcohol can kill! Then they are blamed as being abusers, addicts or even suicidal if they OD, when all along they were trying to get relief from tolerance withdrawals! This is why it's so good you are trying to get off, before it gets that extreme....lucky for some, it never gets to that point if they don't develop tolerance or take them as needed. But the extreme can happen to alot of people, and when it does, look out. So don't give up and take a lesson from Mr. Tortoise, ok? Hope things improve soon for you. . Also, poor Alexandra, cold turkey withdraws are terrible...just be glad you are off them now.

But who knows, maybe it will be different for you or perhaps within the last few years the word on benzos has finally soaked into the medical community enough to get some of them to do something to help those in withdrawal instead of acting like it's of no concern, non-existant, or the patient's own fault.

Good news, though, after awhile into withdrawals mine stopped racing at all and now I've got my old athletic pulse rate again; even can go to the gym and it still stays within my target zone!

Those centers really aren't for us benzo people who only followed the doctor's orders and then found ourselves in tolerance.

Doesn't sound too scientifically accurate to me. Lets face it....they really don't know why the person is anxious. They just call it something that sounds like a real disease thus a diagnois; which implies they know exactly what you have and why by some form of magic I suppose! Maybe doctors get trained in some form of hypnosis so that the word generalized makes the patient think there's something to it all. Of course, I'm kidding. . but it does remind me of an old \"Saturday Night Live\" skit with Steve Martin as a medival doctor who didn't know why bad blood wasn't the right diagnosis and bloodletting was causing all his patients to die..... But, in reality, what if it's really marriage anxiety? What if it's really job anxiety? So what is it really? A bird? A plane? ...well, they never get that far because the prescription pad is faster than a speeding bullet... Howard, I know the benzo board is a downer, but so are these drugs (get it, downer ). Really, how could a board like that not be something other than what it is, because it's a collection of people like you who have been having such an awful time! The stories just can't be too uplifting, you know? I don't think you'll read a topic line like \"I havent' slept in days and loving it!\" or \"Gee, benzos must be good for my heart because it is working so hard I don't have to go to the gym to get a good workout\" I'm not defending the moderators or actions against you, but I don't know what you expected from people who have been hurt by the drugs; should they not be angry or not describe symptoms they are dealing with? (however painful or horrid) What if you dug into a yummy frosted dessert and discovered that the middle was made out of dogfood. Would you not want to read the reviews in the cooking section of your local newspaper? Or what if you didn't want them to print such a horrible story that would make you feel ill....maybe you'd rather hear from people who didn't get sick from the dessert or actually liked it...... I guess I'm rambling but a little reality never hurt anyone. I'm guessing though, that someone you know in the psychiatric/medical community has suggested to you that reading about others and their benzo woes will cause symptoms that are basically in your mind....well, that suggestion is not really dogfood..... it's the aftermath of your dogs' dinner...... doggy doody. So now your thinking, could she BE more bitter? I guess I'll never forget the suffering at the hands of those so-called professionals that got me into those drugs. I am glad you got a day off from symptoms.... "}, "34": {"a": "5891", "t": "So sorry howard that your experience over at the benzo board was bad. Yes, you are right, you can't always assume a symptoms is absolutely from withdrawal, but if it is something that wasn't normal for you before, it's a good guess it's withdrawal. Over at the other support board I belonged to, hosted by the popular search engine(I guess I can't mention here) seemed to have people who would always consider other possibilities of symptoms. I just recently joined the one you went to but I don't really read it much. But you even said you didn't have all your current symptoms pre-benzo; that's a good indicator of the drug's blame, at least for those symptoms. No, I'm not going to say I told you so with the detox, because that wasn't my point; it's only a shame that you were disappointed like that. Well, the only crime from it was the monetary price, and good for you that you had insurance to pay for it at least. As far as the benzo protracted withdrawals research, it is out there. I would have a hard time tracking it all down; if only it was all in one place! However, I found some of it from Dr. Breggins' information. There's alot more but oh I'm not good at fact finding sometimes. Notice he does quote the research sources. There is also mention of alprazolam, which is Xanax. It's a long read but you did say you wanted to see some research on the withdrawal syndrome....and notice although 6 weeks is mentioned as withdrawal, symptoms can persist for \"many\" months (and months make up years of course). One benzo withdrawal doctor who my friend knows said the syndrome averages 3 months to 3 years. That's a broad average but appparently patients he has seen have varied that much. Anyway, on to Breggin's article I pasted below: Clinical experience and the scientific literature confirm that chronic benzodiazepine use impairs mental function in general (reviewed in Breggin, 1998; Lader and Petursson, 1984; Lucki, Rickels, and Geller, 1986 et al., 1994). The existence of chronic or persistent adverse effects after withdrawal from the benzodiazepines is confirmed by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (both the 1987 and 1994 editions) which contain the relevant diagnoses: Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Persisting Dementia (292.82). The existence of these diagnoses in this manual confirms that experts in the field consider that the effects are clinically and scientifically demonstrable (see discussion below). Chronic brain dysfunction can also lead to increased difficulties with disinhibition and loss of impulse control, starting with irritability and mild mood swings, and progressing to more dangerous behavior. Menkes and Laverty (1996) point out that alprazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine similar to lorazepam, is especially prone to cause withdrawal reactions that may be long-lasting: \"Symptoms usually last 1-6 weeks but may persist for many months, leaving the patient in a vulnerable state.\" They note that anxiety, depression, \"paranoid psychoses\" and \"delirium\" may occur. Similarly, the American Psychiatric Association (1990) Task Force on Benzodiazepine Dependence, Toxicity, and Abuse observed that short half-life benzodiazepines are prone to produce \"intense discontinuation syndromes.\" The American Psychiatric Association Task Force (1990) produced a table listing discontinuation symptoms from benzodiazepines in three separate categories: \"very frequent, common but less frequent, and uncommon.\" Very frequent withdrawal symptoms included \"anxiety\", \"agitation\", and \"irritability\", common but less frequent withdrawal reactions included \"depression\" and uncommon withdrawal reactions included \"psychosis\", \"confusion\", \"paranoid delusions\", and \"hallucinations.\" Noteworthy are the large numbers of citations used to confirm the findings listed in the table. The task force also confirmed that these withdrawal symptoms \"may persist up to several weeks (occasionally for months)\" (p. 17). The following two tables from standard sources used in psychiatry summarize many of the withdrawal effects of this class of drugs: From American Psychiatric Association, Benzodiazepine Dependency, Toxicity and Abuse (1990), Table 3, p. 18 Very Frequent: Anxiety Insomnia Restlessness Agitation Irritability Muscle Tension Uncommon: Psychoses Seizures Persistent Tinnitus Confusion Paranoid Delusion Hallucinations From Rapport and Covington Hospital and Community Psychiatry (December 1989), Table I, p. 1278 Emotional / Cognitive: Anxiety Apprehension Fear Irritability Emotional Lability Depression Paranoia Delusions Decreased Memory Decreased Concentration *Perceptual: Disorientation Depersonalization Hallucinations Clouded Consciousness Metallic Taste Paresthesias Sensitivity to light, sound, touch, pain Feeling of Motion *order rearranged Official Scientific Recognition of Benzodiazepine Toxicity and Withdrawal Benzodiazepine toxicity and withdrawal is so well-established that it has received official recognition in the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (1994) in the form of fifteen categories. Each of these diagnoses encompasses the benzodiazepines which are in fact \"sedative\", \"hypnotic\", and \"anxiolytic.\" The fifteen diagnostic categories are: Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal (292.89) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal Delirium (292.81) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Dependence (304.10) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Abuse (305.40) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (292.89) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication Delirium (292.81) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Anxiety Disorder (292.89) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Mood Disorder (292.84) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Persisting Amnestic Disorder (292.83) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Persisting Dementia (292.82) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Psychotic Disorder with Delusions (292.11) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Psychotic Disorder with Hallucinations (292.12) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Sleep Disorder (292.89) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Sexual Dysfunction (292.89) Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified) A similar set of diagnoses can be found in the earlier edition, the DSM-III-R published in 1987. Only five diagnoses are in the 1987 publication under the following rubrics: Sedative, Hypnotic or Anxiolytic abuse, amnestic disorder, dependence, intoxication and withdrawal delirium. However, these categories can subsume all of the ones found in the DSM-VI and indeed the descriptions in the 1987 edition are sometimes more vivid and detailed. These DSM categories are produced by a committee of experts in the specific field and therefore represent an attempt to reach a consensus among those most familiar with the subject, in this case benzodiazepine adverse effects. The inclusion of these multiple benzodiazepine-related disorders in the DSM III-R (1987) and DSM-VI (1994) indicates a consensus that benzodiazepine use can cause all of these problems from amnesia and dementia to withdrawal. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the capacity of benzodiazepines to cause a variety of adverse drug reactions and emotional disturbances is well established as a scientific fact within the scientific community and the psychiatric profession. In forensic or medical-legal terms, there should be no Daubert issue concerning the fact that benzodiazepines can cause all of the adverse reactions subsumed under fifteen categories in the DSM-IV. Patients on long-term benzodiazepines are likely to suffer from many or even all of these disorders. However, patients vary widely in the degree of toxicity and withdrawal reactions that they experience. They will also vary widely in their capacity to understand or describe the adverse drug reactions that they are suffering from "}, "35": {"a": "5891", "t": "Wow that was long. I also just wanted to point out I had the opposite experience with panic than you did. I was having the panic attacks/heart-racing/breathing when I first tried to get off the drugs, but the difference is I hadn't found the website yet and had no idea those symptoms were because of withdrawals! Can you imagine how confused I was at these sudden new symptoms? I had a bunch of tests confirming nothing wrong with my heart, blood, hormones, etc. Even had a brain MRI! So at least finding the website helped me know what it was. That sort of helped me (again, opposite effect for you) because at least I knew the reason. I thought it sucked that it may take months to subside. but I no longer went running to the ER when an attack would come up; I would just relax as best I could and it would calm down after awhile. Sometimes I also breathed and it sounded like asthma weezing so I'd just have some juice and water to help my throat. Months later, the heartrate became more normal again and I could breath again. The only thing that stuck into years was irregular sleep pattern and some muscle twitching, but a steady improvement climb in that. "}, "36": {"a": "5891", "t": "Howard, I always like to think the best of people I suppose so perhaps I am wrong on this but I don't know if they on the benzo board were intending to be hateful; perhaps they just are so intent on attacking benzos that they developed some tunnel-vision along the way as to the various possibilities in various people. But I pretty much believe, since I now know the before, during and aftermath of these drugs, that the chemicals are very capable of causing alot of the symptoms that doctors will automatically assume is some underlying psychiatric problem. And it sounds like you already know this too from reading your response to Forrester. However, tunnel-vision is not my thing and I don't think benzo withdrawals keep other legitamate health problems from developing during that time. That's why I don't view all my physical tests I took before I was aware of benzo problems as wasted because at least that confirmed my physical symptoms were definately withdrawals otherwise something else would have shown up. I thought I had all sorts of ailments/diseases and so did my family, who encougaged me to get all the tests. None of us knew anything about drugs like these. We didn't even know that Ativan was in the same family as Valium....I know....durrrrrrr...but none of us had been exposed to this sort of thing. I guess you could say we were lucky with our health and my family has no history of even alcohol abuse so nobody has had the experience with addictions or chemicals. My knowledge of drugs didn't go much beyond the typical antibiotics and OTC cold meds... So howard, after the withdrawals are over, you may be just fine but that doesn't guarentee life won't decide to cause you stress or anxiety in the future. Stressing out is the modern way of life. Nobody is immune to grief, stress, and life problems in my opinion, even the strongest of us. "}, "37": {"a": "5891", "t": "Hey Forrester, listen to howard; he knows. The doctor always blames original anxiety.....lets' think a minute. If he said it could be the drugs, what would his patients think? They'd be saying, \"What?? How could you give me something that is harmful like this you moron, I trusted you! I'll sue! I'll kill you, I'll beat the living... \"...... haha, well, I doubt that would actually happen unless the patient was a very large, mean sort of fellow. But many patients would be very angry, wouldn't they, or at least very disappointed in what they thought was a professional who was there, trained and armed, to help.....not harm. So logically, it's not in the best interest of the doctor to admit that they made the patient sicker, or worse, drug-dependant. Also, they do have the FDA and drug companies behind them to make them feel all warm and toasty about these drugs. Okay, so nobody actually dies taking normal, theraputic doses of these drugs.... but sometimes there are things in life worse than death! Forrester, you said yourself a bad time in your past started up all those symptoms. So you know the cause of your original condition at least. Is that bad time/issue still significant in your present life? If it isn't, how can you have your original condition still?? There's no logic in the doctors' thinking. For example, if a person was nervous and upset about a divorce, lets' say, and takes a prescription like Xanax for the nervous symptoms. But years later, the person, having found a new person to share life, has moved on. Yet in discontinuing the drug, they have physical withdrawals....so why would that original conditon be to blame at all, in any shape or form, since being nervous/upset/anxious would be a perfectly normal reaction to something like divorce at the time, and now that time has passed? Now, if a person tends to be a \"nervous type\" when trouble arises, that's when the CBT and all that probably would help more with the way of handling the crisis. Why think someone needs to always be drugged to deal with anything? No, there is a real good chance it's now a chemical withdrawal or tolerance issue for you, Forrester. Of course, new bad times/issues will cause it all to be more aggravating and intense....the only way I made it through my protracted, sometimes horrific withdrawal from Ativan was that I had nothing else to bother me at the time.....I realize that was a luxury some don't have! "}, "38": {"a": "5891", "t": "Janik, your doctor's precribing habits may have something to do with that or perhaps many patients do not report adverse symptoms, or when they do he assumes original condition, thus not recognising the withdrawal symptoms. Take insomnia, if you had it before and the pills stop working due to some tolerance, well, it will always be assumed it's the old problem. But I have personally known people who had bouts of insomnia that lasted months; what was different about them is they didn't take any drugs for it and it finally left on it's own! \"Original\" conditions like this are sometimes not permanent but for some reason the medical community think they are so naturally never suspect drug tolerance/withdrawals. They just continue prescribing....I mean...how do we explain the high doses some people get on after many years but they do have prescriptions still! I also have heard from those patients who need even higher doses because of extreme tolerance don't tell their doctor (because he won't prescribe any higher) that they obtain benzos illegally to add to their prescriptions or augment their benzo use with alcohol...I've heard these stories in the past on these boards and the support groups. Some doctors never know what their patients are doing behind their backs. Then there are some patients stop complaining and \"accept\" that they will always have some troubles and continue the medication. Here's one real life example...... my husband travels in his job, and one trip he was invited to a colleague's house for dinner. Well, he has told everyone about my benzo adventure, so the conversation came up about the collegue's wife. She's been on Ambien for 3 years for sleep, and said it works so she's happy with it. Hmmmmm.... Well, when my husband questioned her further, she disclosed to him she really only got about 3 hours of sleep a night on it!!!! At first she got alot more. Apparentely she had become used to such a life basically because she felt 3 hours were better than none without the Ambien. So this is something she learned to accept...so the obvious insomnia symptom of withdrawal on the nights she tried to not take it and the not so obvious withdrawals after she took it at night (which explains the short action) was no doubt ignored as withdrawals.... So I can see where doctors get the \"low percentages\" of patients having of withdrawals since most time they are ignored or blamed on something else, or patients like my husband's collegue just stop complaining and accept. "}, "39": {"a": "5891", "t": "Hey there, howard.....I know alot of women who had problems with benzos were working women, so enough with the housewives bashing Ha, well, all kidding aside, I wonder why you thought there was no research on the connection of GABA and benzos...all you have to do is type in benzodiazepines and GABA in a search to find some. Also, Prof. Ashton does explain this connection in her manual in Chapter I: The benzodiazepines: what they do in the body. She also does address the issue of protracted withdrawals in a later chapter, here's a small excerpt: \"PROTRACTED WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS A minority of people who have withdrawn from benzodiazepines seem to suffer long-term effects - protracted symptoms that just don't go away after months or even years. It has been estimated that perhaps 10-15 per cent of long-term benzodiazepine users develop a \"post-withdrawal syndrome\". Many of these people have taken benzodiazepines for 20 years or more and/or have had bad experiences in withdrawal. The incidence of protracted symptoms in those who have undergone a slow taper under their own control is almost certainly very much lower.\" ..... So howard, I don't know what exactly constitutes a \"bad experience\" but since slow taperers seem to have more success and escape the protracted, that would be one; I suppose alot of switching drugs or adding drugs would be another...that stuff happened to me so I'm thinking that's why I had protracted withdrawals. The thing is, I actually thought I wouldn't be one to have the protracted withdrawals because of my normal nature....which is very positive and healthy. Besides being one who enjoyed staying home with my kids like we were at Disneyland everyday, I was a fitness enthusiast, especially weight-training. I also hated the party scene. . smoking, drugs and drinking to me were not only unhealthy but a waste of time. So I was quite surprised and dissapointed as I passed the year mark and still had problems. I guess a positive mindset helps but the physical reality of my doctor giving me a high dose of Ativan, trying Klonopin and Serzone and fast switches/tapers took a toll. I went to GPs' first, and had some rounds with Restorial and Ambien too. At the end I was only on Ativan and having tolerance, the psych doc wanted to double my dose and try to add Luvox to the mix...that's when I thought \"this is going to end even if I die\". So I did a taper(I was told later it was too fast) off the Ativan and did not set foot in the doc's office again. My husband was the one to call him and give the news I wasn't coming back. Anyway, my whole mess started with adverse reaction to codiene a GP gave me for a cold. If only she admitted this, I could have stopped it all there! I would have never consulted another doc, which lead to usage of benzos. I was told codiene has no withdrawals....well, I much later found the list of narcotic withdrawals and all my first symptoms were on the list! I was probably either sensitive or given too much possibly, no matter, if only doctor's had the guts to say even that it's a possibility to have withdrawals from their prescription drugs....maybe it would have saved me alot of suffering/ wondering if I had come down with some disease/ and running all over taking tests.... "}, "40": {"a": "5891", "t": "I forgot to mention too howard, that it was probably wise to leave the benzo board. Although I think they mean well, it's not going to help you to have to justify your questions/beliefs on your personal withdrawals nor argue constantly about symptoms and such. I doubt you actually \"harmed\" yourself, but maybe that's why the withdrawals may have not gone so smoothly. However, I read that slow tapering is not a guarentee of easy withdrawals either. I guess some people are bitter over at the board. I understand this because I am too, but I realize that as a former benzo user, you can only provide useful info and help to others during this because like you said, even Ashton knows there are many differences in people/situations of withdrawal. She also said in her manual to not expect to get every symptom on the list!! And I agree, she seems pretty cool "}, "41": {"a": "5891", "t": "I don't know if Forrester is still reading this thread, but I just wanted to say you can find benzo referances and help by looking for the Ashton Manual (it's free) and also typing in benzo withdrawal for other sites and support. "}, "42": {"a": "5891", "t": "Ah, I get ya! Well, they are unique because they effect their own GABA \"ring\". Ok, bear with me, I read this a long time ago about the GABA receptor rings (I think that's how they were described on a research page which I wish now I would have saved off!) Maybe I can find it later! Anyway, there was supposed to be a ring of the GABA receptor that was the receiver of both alcohol and barbituates....thus the untimely deaths of many people who uses to mix barbs with alcohol. The other ring was exclusivly receiver of benzodiazepines. All the rings together made up the GABA receptors, thus all three of these drugs realistically effect GABA itself. They are all considered CNS depressants mainly due to effects on GABA. But the benzos took up a whole ring by itself, unlike alcohol and barbituates...so I guess that's the reason it is so different than most CNS depressants. It has a larger effect because of that. All I know is, even Ashton and others like her who have knowledge of many psychoactive drugs say that benzos are the only drug they know of that can have such a long, protracted version of withdrawal.....but as you have read, lots of factors and variables make withdrawals different in different people, so protracted withdrawal only happens to a small percentage compared to all the benzo users. But since so many use benzos these days, that can amount to alot of people, huh? So why not at least warn people of this possibility so they don't give up too soon? But howard, if anyone was telling you that your personal withdrawal will be protracted, then they would be wrong, because there is really no definate way to predict it....time only tells. Why, I've heard stories about CT people having little or no withdrawals at all! Of course, they are the few, and also that's a bit dangerous because of threat of seizures, so I wouldn't recommend that at all. So I hope I answered some of the questions a little. If I were you howard, I wouldn't worry about protracted withdrawals because there's a good chance that won't be happening to you. You are already having some normal, non-symptom days already, and I can tell you as someone who did experience protracted withdrawals (and yes it's horrible but survivable) that usually most of us don't have symptom-free days for weeks to months after drug discontinuation. You are already showing signs of improvement this early, so that's a good sign! But I guess the reason Ashton is so dominant is because she is one of a very small percentage of the medical community that even put forth effort to explore benzos and their effects/withdrawals. I have heard she never took them, but I do wonder why she became interested in benzos in particular during her work. Anyway, I don't think there is that much out there as far as other researchers because funding is hard to obtain; the ones who bankroll the big research are the drug companies, and that's usually to find something favorable about their meds.

Mine didn't even start to hint at backing off intil a month, and then it was a really small hint! Also, you didn't take the drugs long, especially at your higher dose. But that doesn't mean it will be quick and easy, but as long as you are determined (sounds like you are!) , you'll beat this no sweat (well, maybe a little sweat!) It's interesting how you mentioned maybe they don't know...I think there's alot they don't know, not only about benzos but other psychoactive drugs. They even admit it in the PDF's on some drugs like SSRi's and commercials. They still can't make up their minds if ADD kids need dopamine drugs like Adderall(speed) or Strattera (a norephinprine re-uptake inhibitor in the old antidepressant class) Everyone these days seem to be living, breathing brain experiments....and it seems almost everyone is on something.

I've heard about this kind of thing alot; it is a result of doctors' experiementing with your head without really being able to show you any proof of any neurotransmitter deficiency; it's theory and guesswork. Even diabetics have the proof of blood sugar levels from tests, and treatment is based on that type of accurate science. Well, first off, I'm not a professional so don't take what I say as gospel, as I am only guessing based on things I've read about these drugs. But your doc is guessing too, sooo... Xanax is a benzodiazepine, which is a depressant but sometimes can have paradoxial reactions, or the opposite of what it's supposed to do. Who knows why all the sudden it changed on you like that, but here's something to think about. When people take depressants, eventually the brain defends itself by trying to set up oppossing receptors. Oppossing receptors to benzos would be the opposite of calming receptors, or excitatory ones. So now the brain has too many of those...this eventually leads to tolerance. But in your case, perhaps you had only developed a few at the time, and here comes Zoloft and then Lexapro ....both are excitary drugs since serotonin is an excitatory neurotransmitter, thus the feeling of jumping out of your skin! Now, this is a common reaction with SSRi's but maybe you were more sensitive because of a slight tolerance of your Xanax, or your extra excitory receptors were being stimulated too much... So now the Xanax is not working, in fact, doing the opposite because all these drugs sort of caused some imbalance in the receptors. Don't be scared....the brain has this great way of recovering from chemicals....think about it, how could anyone recover from cocaine addiciton if the brain didn't have a good system of recovering itself? The brain is unlike any other organ in that way. So you will recover; lots of people have. It just may take a little time. Try to wean off your Xanax very carefully and see if you feel better. It's always wise not to quit CT from benzos. If you feel worse, you could continue the Xanax if it starts to work right again, but once you feel normal, try to wean off it or only save it for emergency as you do want to avoid tolerance buildup in the future. Lucky for you, all this was short-lived so your recovery could be very swift. But still realize that some people can take a few months to recover or at least feel alot better, so be patient; try to eat right and exercise mildly in the meantime.

They seem to go only on knowledge of this neurotransmitter and that, and which ones that drugs seem to affect. Yet there are no biological tests for brain chemicals; no measure for serotonin, dopamine, GABA etc in the human, living brain. That leaves way too much room for things to go wrong! I can't imagine taking insulin with only symptoms to go on and no blood sugar level tests. Well, I just thought I'd express my concerns; no ill will intended towards you! It's just that your statement raised some thoughts I have on the subject. Howard, I'm glad you are still at it. You are also right in that even benzos have a purpose; in fact, I think anesthesia during surgery was the original use for them but I could be wrong.

If there was any way you could take a bit less, I would. Tapering doesn't necessarily have to be scheduled in the sense that you could take years to get off them if you wanted to; your body can get used to taking the slightly lower doses eventually, and someday that might lead to getting off completely. It is a possibility. "}, "52": {"a": "5891", "t": "Unfortunately, PA's can also be a withdrawal or intra-dose symptom of benzo use. Origin of the original PA's could maybe not be a factor this far out sometimes, depending on what the cause was of course. At this point, the drugs could be keeping them alive. I am saying this because I knew some people who originally took benzos for panic; when they weaned off benzos, they found themselves not having any more PA's after the withdrawal and recovery period.... so they could only assume that the origin cause of their PA's no longer existed after that many years and that the drugs had simply caused their own symptoms! So, if you could wean off daily use ever so slowly and then only take a bit of the pill when having a PA, perhaps they might go away down the road. That part is hard to predict because you don't know what causes your PA's at this point, it could be the drug tolerance withdrawals or the original cause from years ago....confusing I know. I don't know; it's really up to you since you've been on the drugs for so long. Some people only take a pill during a PA and do not take them daily....that in itself would be a step to help avoid more tolerance in the future if you could get down to that sort of use, or \"as needed use\" instead of daily doses. But you can't just stop taking the daily doses without very slow weaning, and there may be severe withdrawals even with slow weaning, although some people report very mild withdrawals with a super-slow wean. All I know, you should proceed with great caution. I would not do anything drastic. A simple small cut in dose would be all I would do, and if that worked out ok, I would still stay on that dose for at least 2 weeks or so before cutting even the slightest bit again....since you have alot of other health issues now, I wouldn't be quick to wean for sure, and I would be under a doctor's care and supervision while doing so, that is if you can find a doctor who supports your desires.

It sounds like you had alot of stresses that could also trigger PA's as well in your past, being in the military and teaching are very stressful jobs from what I've heard. It's a shame the timing was bad for you concerning PA's since you are right in saying that many years ago they really didn't know about Xanax and benzo dangers at all. They were new meds and they were replacing the notorious barbituates, so it seemed at the time they had something better. Good luck; hope the Xanax continues to work; it sounds like you built a very slow tolerance so you could get lucky there in the fact it could keep working for many years to come. I usually tell people to get off the benzos like Xanax at any cost but with your health and age it could be dangerous to do so. I do think you are wise to avoid SSRi's, they can be very stimulating to the nervous system (opposite of Xanax) as serotonin is an excitatory neurotransmitter, and I think they are very bad for health; you don't need anything like that! Right now, because they have finally discovered benzo addiction after all these years plus benzos are older, cheaper drugs, the newer generation of AD's like Wellbutrin and Paxil are being \"pushed\" in place of benzos as better because of claims they are non-addictive, but they have severe withdrawal syndromes like any addictive drug! I doubt they are any better than benzos. Besides, the term \"addiction\" is technically associated with compulsive, drug/euphoria seeking behavior, so they can claim their SSRI's do not cause that. But they fail to admit those drugs cause physical dependancy, which is not truly addiction because dependancy just means the brain gets used to(dependant) on the drug doing certain functions for it, whereas real addiction has the behavioral component. This was explained on a website about benzos. This is why many people on prescribed doses of benzos should not be labeled addicted, but rather dependant. Addicts are a different story; they don't take the benzos to feel normal, they usually take them in high doses to feel drunk or sometimes benzos are simply used as drugs to help an addict \"come down\" from other drugs like cocaine. So don't worry about \"addiction\" itself; in your case it's simply dependancy which is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about! "}, "55": {"a": "5891", "t": "You are welcome.

Tardive dyskinesia is a disfiguring, irreversable condition....now, you will be assured by your doctor that it doesn't happen to everyone on those drugs, but it is a disfiguring, horrible condition so I don't think anyone should risk it just in case since it can cause the person to become disabled. Even the diabetes risk is something to ponder as that's no picnic disease either. I don't think I'd take those drugs long term or UP any dosages. They have to also be slowly weaned off.

And the fact that I am doing all of this seemingly in secret in my small community without the supervision of a physician does not help. No face to face support. And am on a drug now that I may not get a refill for. But perhaps I need to say forget the job, health first, and do what is necessary to preserve it.

How long would surely depend on many factors. But the mind is a powerful thing. If someone is told they will suffer from a list of certain symptoms long term then they probably will...

Anxiety and it`s multiple manifestations are the withdrawal symptoms. One can become dependent on these drugs after just a few weeks of use. Is hard to tell if your symptoms are from withdrawal or if it is pre-existing anxiety re-surfacing. You doctor will almost surely tell you the latter as it keeps him off the hook for prescribing this very addictive drug for more than a few weeks... "}, "76": {"a": "26087", "t": "Jennita, On the benzo.org board... I was told a matter of factly that I had done additional harm to myself by doing the last legs of my taper in detox and rejecting their super slow Valium taper. They know they do not know this. It is thus fair to assume that such involves an intentional attempt to injure someone who posed questions they had difficulty answering. Thank you for supplying the research, but I was already aware of and excepted the contents. What I would like to see is broad based collective research to comfirm that long term (months, years) withdrawal symptoms occur in most cases, or even in most cases of benzo dependent people that \"taper too fast.\" I was all but being promised this outcome at benzo.org... As to the reality of benzo related physical withdrawal symptoms, that has never been questioned either. What has been noted is that one`s outlook and thinking can magnify the symptoms. Ashton herself acknowledges this. She encourages healthy liefstyle changes, spirituality, relaxation technics etc. Sitting around reading on the computer about how you will probably become an emotional criple for months or years while losing everything you worked for would surely be at odds with this. Especially seeing that there appears to be no scientific evidence to support the notion. Maybe what we have here is housewives who are not at risk of finding themselves in the street begging for a meal. That is in no way meant to be a slight against housewives, but they can better afford the diversions... "}, "77": {"a": "26087", "t": "Jennita, I just have had difficulty communicating. I know there is research or at least medical assertions regarding GABA and benzos. What I am not aware of is any research to indicate the unique nature of benzos in this regard. Other CNS depressents also affect GABA. And chronic alcoholics often suffer long term nervous system related symptoms after coming off, as do those that were on opiates. All I found from Ashton was that removing benzos leaves the nervous system in a \"hyeractive state,\" makes perfect sense, but this also applies to other drugs. As to protracted withdrawals, what a horrible thing, as Ashton defines it as symptoms that last over a year. She asserts that faster taperers are more at risk for this. I suppose this is based on her own exerience. But what percentage of faster taperers suffer over a year or even over a month, is from what I can tell so far left to mystery. Though Ashton`s research is the most dominant on the net and usually comes up at the top of the list when doing searches, it is not the final word for me. A large internet presence does not necessarily equate with correctness, nor with objectivity and a wide range of experiences.

You may want to discuss a slow taper regime with your doctor. I was not good at tapering. One problem was that I had plenty of pills and kept giving in a bad times, especially on the weekends.

Was going along my merry way, not giving my benzo intake any second thought. In fact I thought it was a Godsend. Yet it eventually came down to this, start climbing into toxic doses where I may or may not find withdrawal relief, or take a course of action to get off. Was often disheartened by the bad news I was getting. I had no clue. No doctor ever led me on. They just said, \"they CAN be addictive,\" but kept prescibing. I suppose it is typical for many docs to wait until you are then wash their hands and refer you out. I tried a few GPs and all said the same thing, \"go to detox or a psychiatrist.\" One had the integrity not to charge me but not the courtesy to ever look me in the eye. The Valium taper seems better for me. I am two months into it, including crossover time from Klonopin. Why? This benzo is very long acting. It does not drop you like the others, leaving you with the panic type state. it stays smooth in the system much longer. Valium is no miracle. I still feel like I have the flu a lot of the time when I do not. I get the electric stuff but it is mild. I get some sinking sort of breathless feelings that come and go. Some insomnia. But I function so far. I am at a bit over 20 mgs a day now and taper just 2.5 mgs every two weeks. On the last 10 mgs, will slow to a 1 mg cut every two weeks as it is tougher at the smaller doses as the cut percentages become greater. For example, I do not want to taper 10 mg is just a month. This is about a 6 month plan total. As suggested, do searches like \"benzo, support, forums.\" Is plenty of help out there. One problem one could face, it is is hard finding American docs to prescribe Valium, but persistance can pay off. Keep posting. Everyone who has or is living in this dilema, I am on your side. I believe there is a way out. "}, "83": {"a": "26087", "t": "Pat, Lay it on me. I am tapering but never have tapered well, first or second round, whether fast or slow. I hardly \"stabilize,\" whatever that means. Frankly, I would postpone this a year or two until things settle down if I thought I could. But strongly suspect updosing would only be responded with tolerance withdrawals rather quickly and thus a deeper hole to get out of. Benzos got me early, within a year and one half. Cannot relate to the years and years people. Am just now solidifying my career. And unlike many, do not have employer support or the resources to lay up for any length of time, unless it`s in the woods. My physician support is sketchy at best also. And unlike some in some foreign countries, I`d be laughed at trying to get temporary disability for this in my state. So I would love to hear what you have to say. I see no PM feature on this site, and do not know if posting e-mail addresses is allowed. Those are possibilities or you can just toss it all out right here as long as the site will stand the bandwidth. "}, "84": {"a": "26087", "t": "Tony, With all due respect, I must borrow a word from Jennita and call your doc a \"ditz.\" He prescribes Xanax for 5 years then cries addiction?? Maybe he just got around to reading the pharm company literature that states the drug should not be prescribed for over 2 to 4 weeks! My docs justified continuing prescribing by saying that .5 mg a day is \"not that much.\" Nonsense. Many have gotten in trouble at that dose, myself being one. But you were being prescibed that 3 times a day. That is equivalent to 30 mgs of Valium a day, a lot of benzo. I personally would get off that drug, Xanax, but it is short acting and hard to taper from. I suggest, politely at first, reminding this doc of their prescibing practices. This will take them down a notch. Then ask for a long acting benzo to taper with, Valium, not Klonopin which most push, as it is much shorter acting and very potent. A most proper tapering regime is 10% of the starting dose every two weeks. Pharmacists know this. Few doctors do, amazingly. It is very possible that your panic episodes are due to Xanax withdrawal. I understand the need for emergency pills for panic episodes. All of mine have been drug related, none prior to benzos. May not hurt to carry a few pills around for a while in case. But there are non-chemical ways of dealing with panic. Is a lot of info on the web and some docs specialize in it. In essence the fight-flight mechanism in the brain engages for no good reason. One solution is not to run, to hold your ground, distract yourself, stick with what you are doing and maybe take some slow deep breathes. But if the panic is vert chemical related, in the heat of early benzos withdrawal, particularly cold turkey, is not much that is going to stop it, in spite of what ignorant detox nurses say. Wish I had more answers. There are many mysteries and variables in this game. "}, "85": {"a": "26087", "t": "Pat, Thanks, extremely interesting post. I am not ready to say yet what will or will not work for me so I am pretty open minded. It sounds as though you tapered real slow, back off if you felt it, then soon tapered again, never updosing, keeping the goal in mind. Your method is all new to me. Is late and I am going to read and digest it more tomorrow. If my synopsis is wrong, do correct me. Please stick around. My situation does seem a bit different. I had long term/short term (depending on definitions) use at a small dose then a rapid ascent into tolerance. Since then, I have had symptoms every day, first try, second try, slow and fast tapers. Many say I am a good candidate for \"rehab, cold turkey,\" but am not going there again, though I may consider it if I feel just as bad tapering as I did when I cold turkeyed before. But no more disease model, push you all day centers again. If only to keep my insurance company from being raped again, even if they would pay a second time.

Maybe I am getting used to pain, electricity, and feeling like I have the flu, have had it for 5 months now. Can even let my heart get a workout without wanting to run to the ER, but that has been rare the last couple of months. So I guess it boils down to this, no easy way out. Keep on with life`s daily routines if you can, or if you can make yourself. Actually, going on, working, doing things I have always enjoyed either rids the symptoms or gets my mind off of them.

The symptoms I experience while tapering are consistent with those reported by other coming off Valium, but the drug I used most often before switching fully over to Valium about 3 months ago was Klonopin. These seem extra powerful and perhaps of what I am experiencing is due to the after effects of the K, but doubt it. Have not taken one in near two months. How do I cut 1 mg a week? Crush the pill, measure out lines with a good eye and remove. As slow as it this sounds it may be too fast for me as this week was rough. Some are lucky. Others like me, may have to feel a lot of pain to get through this one. I just try to eat right, exercise a bit, work, and not worry. Symptoms are symptoms.

And this from a specialist in the US about benzodiazepenes as I mentioned earlier: By Timothy C Hain, MD \"In small doses, benzodiazepenes are extremely useful for suppressing vestibular responses. Addiction, impaired memory, increased risk of falling, and impaired vestibular compensation are their main shortcomings. Lorazepam is a particularly useful agent because of its effectiveness and simple kinetics. Addiction, the biggest problem, can usually be avoided by keeping the dose to 0.5 mg BID or less. Similarly, low doses of diazepam (Valium) (2 mg) can be quite effective. Clonazepam (Klonopin), is as effective a vestibular suppressant as lorazepam. The author prefers to avoid use of alprazolam (Xanax) for vestibular suppression, because of the potential for a difficult withdrawal syndrome.

Fifteen inch scar from the very top of butt crack (sorry), to the bra line. BAK cages, rods & screws. (Titanium) My pelvic bone was used for grafting. Praying that the other two discs in between, won't have to be fused later, as I was told it was a possibility, due to the other two discs in between, not being in that great of shape. Doc didn't want to fuse four levels, unless it is really necessary. I would hate to repeat the surgery, as the recovery period, is so very painful. I also have a free fragment in my T11-12 area, that I'm still refusing surgery for, at this point in time. That surgery is way too dangerous for me to consider, until if affects my being able to walk.

However, that whole episode has left a very bad taste in my mouth. I have become very angry with the medical profession . I can't beleive that Bitc* Jessica still has her job. Why is it that some girls are so catty? She must have been jealous of you or something for her to be so mean. LOL. . I agree with you as far as her doing favors on the side. How else could someone still have their job after pulling that crap with you? If most of the other girls hate her, she must be doing something!LOL I don't blame you for taking action against her. What she did was wrong and totally unfair. I look at it as though. . she took food from your table, and thats not good Baxter, I would hold her accountable for what she did to you, because she could be doing this to other people that she doesn't like, and you probably just aren't aware of it. I would like to know how she got away with doing that? Was she ever repramanded? (sp?) I just don't understand people sometimes. A judge would def rule in your favor. I think she intentionally did it to harm you, and thats scary with her working in the medical field. The sad thing is, here you are in pain, just having surgery, having to run all over the place to get records for something that the Bitc* could have taking care of in 5 mins...geez that makes me angry! I hope everything goes in your favor I have a appointment with my family doc on wednesday and I am going to ask him for some Xanax. I think I need something for the way I have been feeling. If Xanax is a tenquilizer then I know for sure I will get some ZZZZ's and that would make me very happy. Keep me posted on what happens with LTD and the Bitc*. Also thanks for the info on editing. . it worked YEAH! Since I already look stupid, now I can ask you how do you delete a message? I tried, but it wouldn't let me. You would think I would know how to do this by now, since my husband says I am addicted to this site Thanks again Brenda "}, "5": {"a": "71493", "t": "Hi Lspine WOW, that is awful! I am soooooo sorry that you had to go through that. I have heard that having an abcessed just alone can be painful. I am not surprised that when you asked the doc if it could harm your baby that he said \"who knows\". It was just like the doctor at the ER asking me \"what do you want me to do?\" Doctors can be so arrogant sometimes, because they know that you are at their mercy when you need their help. I know I become very vulnerable when I am in pain. I am sorry that you had to go through that, especially when you were expecting. We already feel bad enough, why do they want to add to it? Lspine, I agree with you that there are drug seekers out there, and I am sure there are many, but I feel as though doctors shouldn't think that everyone who has back pain or in any pain is a drug seeker. I also agree with you that we are guilty before proven innocent. There has got to be a way that the doctors can destinguish the difference between drug seeker and someone with sureal pain. They are suppose to be so educated and smart, why can't they tell? I think back to that night and wonder if I did anything to make him think that way, and I can't come up with anything. I even brought my pain meds with me, just incase they needed to see what I was taking. If I was a drug seeker, wouldn't I be seeking drugs because I didn't have any? This is what has me confused. I had pain meds...they just weren't working for some reason. Now as far as your pharmacy incident, well that would have really ****** me off! I feel so bad for you and I am sorry to hear that this happened to you. Boy, I thought I had it bad, you just made me feel a lot better. I can't beleive that they still gave you a hard time, even after showing them your incision...unbeleivable!!!!! However, I do know that I have gone to the pharmacy on several occasions the day before my pills ran out to get it refilled, and they have given me a hard time. Even if it is only one day! I automatically tell them to call my doctor, because I can not function without them physically, first thing in the morning. I know one thing for sure, if I know I will not have my pain meds for the morning, I panic. I don't see why it is a big deal to the pharmacy to fill meds one day prior. I can see if you are trying to get your prescription filled one or two weeks early, but come on...a day! This whole thing has been very hard on me. I never really paid much attention to all the hoopla that they sometimes talk about on 20/20 about drugs, but I bet you I will now. It is hard to beleive but very true, that people who really need pain meds are the ones that have trouble getting them. I guess it depends all on the doctor. The person you met should not be on the pain meds that you described, and you should be able to get something besides darvocet for when you over extended yourself. From what I have heard, the surgery that you had is a very hard surgery, and recovery takes awhile. To think that you only get darvocet is crazy. I do wish you well and the best of luck recovering. What angers me is, if that person who has had a less invasive surgery that was done over a year ago, and had no complications, then to me, that is a drug seeker. Unless, something else medically is happening. Do you see what I mean? That is what has me so ****** off I just don't get it. I bet if the person that you are speaking about, went to the emergency room, the doc probably wouldn't say anything to them. I know I can't change anything by bitc****, but I am angry about the way I was treated . I guess it is just another bad experience, that has been happening to me a lot latley. I guess we learn through bad experiences. Lspine, I wish the best for you, and hope that things are well. I will pray that you will recover fully without any pain. May the s watch over you!

I'm 46 and am in peri. Until the last year, I had never had issues with anxiety. But I am now in therapy and take low dose (1/2mg.) of xanax as needed. My Psychiatrist has prescribed up to 2-3 per day. I have also, recently learned I have elevated thyroid and high blood pressure. These are all possible symptoms of menopause. It's amazing what the doctors don't tell you. I've known women my age and older who have had these symptoms pop up and they have gone to their physicians and have been told it's not from menopause. I went to my Primary doc and my OB/GYN and thankfully they both agree that it is possible. They are running more tests to rule out other things, but have not discounted the hormonal fluctuation and it's role in all of my symptoms. Just some food for thought...Good luck and God Bless, cmpgirl PS: Forgot to mention, I take my xanax usually 1/2 pill at a time to prevent drowsiness during the day. If it's not helping within an hour I will take the second half. At night I will take a whole pill if needed. I also have dry eyes, but I'm not sure if it's the Xanax or the other things I have going on.

What I do is if I start feeling anxious, I will usually take a half a tab (1/4mg) In about 15 minutes if I still feel the anxiety building I immediately take the other half of the pill. I can keep doing that as long as I don't go over the prescribed daily dose. I find this works better for me, because that way if I don't need the whole dose, I don't have to take it. It's based really on how bad my anxiety is. If I get one of those sudden out of the blue panic attacks, I will take 2 tabs, which equals 1 whole mg., but I've been learning in therapy to recognize what things trigger my anxiety and try to nip it in the bud, so to speak. I can usually tell when I'm starting to get anxious, by how I'm breathing, if I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed etc. But for those times that I don't see it coming, I'll take the full 1mg right away. I hope I explained that OK. My heads a little foggy today. If you are at a point where you are in a constant state of anxiety, maybe a different type of med is in order, like lexapro or paxil etc. Do you have constant anxiety or does it come and go?

They are \"downers\". Most anti-benzo people never took more than their doctor gave them (how could you, unless you knew a dealer on the street); however, many doctors actually like to increase the doses when a patient starts to develop tolerance(stops working). So doctors, in trying to cover the symptoms, end up causing the problem with \"addiction\". This event can happen after months or years of taking pills. The only real way to avoid this is to take \"as needed\"(not everyday), or if daily dosing is extremely low (although some do develop tolerance on low doses but not as likely). When I developed tolerance, it was my doctor, NOT I: he was the one pushing for higher dose!! I then realized what was going on and got off without his \"approval\"...endured alot of withdrawals for over 2 years but I can say I am doing well today. I also found out much later on, that a medication I was taking for a medical illness caused my initial symptoms.... which lead to the prescription of my benzo, Ativan. So the whole mess could have been avoided if one doctor could have been honest. Also, benzo \"addiction\" is not common in theraputic dose. . instead, it is usually \"dependancy\". Dependancy is a physical condition, which can be part of addiction, but addiction itself has to consist of other components. Quite frankly, since they are \"downers\", there isn't much there in the \"euphoria\" department, (high dose only put you to sleep!) , so actual addictions usually occur with more euphoric drug like cocaine, heroin and speed. Not exactly a drug to party on... Anyway, it might be helpful to you to look at my \"dependancy vs. addiction\" post on this board, as written by a knowledgable addictions doctor. Just try to be careful in regards to Xanax; for occassional anxiety, I'd recommend a stiff drink instead over a pill, although personally I hate the taste of alcohol and avoid it. I don't suffer from anxiety much but I have heard chammomile tea does wonders. "}, "1": {"a": "5891", "t": "Janik, You are correct. I know some people who had very little withdrawals, or none at all. But it's not the typical scenario. Also, sometimes people do get benzos in theraputic doses for medical ailments, but when they stop, find themselves in withdrawals. I personally know one fellow who was a bodybuilder and hurt his back. The doc gave him Valium for the muscle spasms while the back was healing. When his back was fine, his doc figured he could just stop the Valium since it is the weakest benzo and it was a small, daily dosage. But the poor guy went through severe insomnia, anxiety etc.(typical withdrawals) for a whole year! He never suffered from such symptoms in his life. He's fine now, back to bodybuilding but an actively involved in anti-benzos, or as some on this board would put it, an anti-benzo \"zealot\". However, I don't blame him for being angry over that one year of his life and subsequently getting involved in the benzodiazepine debate. His case certainly puts these \"wonder drugs\" in some scrutiny, at the very least. I'm not saying these drugs are evil or poison, etc. They actually are useful anesthetics for surgery and medical procedure, or in emergency cases of extreme shock. I just don't think they are a healthy \"habit\" to have as part of daily life, and can cause many health-related problems which are usually ignored or assumed from other causes.

A woman named Heather Ashton basically brought benzo troubles to light...her manual called the Ashton Manual is now free online. But if you must know what I did, here's what happened...not only did I get every blood test in the book plus an EEG and MRI, I also got a special hormone test from my gyno which was quite expensive!

Otherwise, move to California...whoops, well, our earthquakes are a bit scary too. I'm so used to them I rarely even run for the doorway...lived with them forever.

In order for a generic drug to be sold legally on the market it must meed FDA standards which require that the active ingredient be identical to the name brand. The fillers may be different and the active ingredient may vary in amount, but not by 20%. The generic drug needs to go through testing in order to prove its efficacy versus the name brand. The fillers may be different, but the filler is a benign substance that should not cause any effects to the user. Thus, \"inactive ingredients\".

But I see you're not talking about the active ingredient being different as far as what it actually is... The main point of this thread was to let people know that they might not actually have to move up to another dose if they are taking generic; they might be able to stay at the same dose if they tried the brand name, instead. Also, there are times that certain fillers a generic manufacturer uses makes a person sick; if this is the case, a switch to a different generic manufacturer or the brand name might make all the difference in the world.

I'm going to stay here until I see my doc in mid June. Maybe my body needs some adjusting to the Prozac before I increase it. Did I tell you that my doc said that you wouldn't take Prozac and Cymbalta together because they both block the same chemical or something. She was going to suggest Zoloft with the Cymbalta instead. Apparently Paxil and Prozac are two that she said wouldn't be compatible with Cymbalta, i guess any of the other ones would be. At that point I had already come off Cymbalta because I was getting numbness around my mouth after taking it. It was very weird but hasn't happened since I stopped taking it. So maybe you should add just a tad of something else instead of Prozac. Something more calming. I heard Prozac can be agitating. I also have been REALLY trying to give up sugar. My blood sugar goes up and down all day and I'm really sensitive to it mood wise. Keeping it more steady with more protein and complex carbs has helped. I also was trying this so I wouldn't gain weight and maybe lose some. In addition to exericising every day!!!

Hang in there and maybe try to just stick with one dosage for awhile before cutting back and forth so youdon't feel so ill. I know that weaning slowly has helped me in the past. Take care, Chris "}, "23": {"a": "27567", "t": "Hi Rashelle It was good to hear from you. The first part of my week I was really tired and down. Then on Thursday, which is PMS time for me, I felt really good and still do today. I still feel a bit numb, like can't get excited, but not as bad. I look forward to things though and feel motivated. I still have NOOO sex drive though. I am going to ask the doc if I can add a tad of Wellbutrin to the Prozac and see if that helps. I also started this new exercise routine. It's in this month's Prevention Magazine it says you'll drop a size by July 4th if you do this 4 week program. I started on Monday and, I feel it working already. THe key is WEIGHTS! I've always known that Using weights builds muscles which speeds your metabolism up, but I guess I just got lazy and didn't do them for awhile. I think with the effect that SSRI's can have on your metabolism, the weights help to offset that. I don't have PMS yet either, which is cool. My mood has been fluctuating though, I'm hoping to have some evening out of my moods in the weeks to come. I'm hoping the Prozac has kicked in fully now after 4 weeks and that it will be better now. I also started using a Progesterone cream for some perimenopausal symptoms and short menstrual cycles I was having. This is the first month, so maybe it will help to even out things. I still take 10mg of the Prozac, but was really close to going up to 20mg earlier this week since I am premenstrual. I feel like the initial agitation i had has decreased a lot now too. I hope you can find the right mix for you. I feel like the Cymbalta was doing weird things to me mood wise at the end of taking it so maybe it is not letting the Prozac work as effectively for you. Have you ever taken and SSRI and Wellbutrin? I know some on the boards have and there's mixed results. Take care, Chris "}, "24": {"a": "27567", "t": "Hi Rashelle I can't say that I have any side effects lately other than sexual with the Prozac. The initial agitation and flat feeling has subsided. I'm sorry that you are feeling so crappy. I can remember my last few days of Cymbalta feeling really crappy. Then I started getting weird tingling in my face after taking it so that was it for me. I was on another thread and saw a discussion on Buspar. Have you ever tried this??? I think that it can be effective for some people as an anti-anxiety with little side effects. My doc gave it to me when I was on Wellbutrin to offset the anxiety,but I never gave it a chance. It seems that some people take it with an SSRI for anxiety. Many docs don't prescribe it anymore because there are the Xanax type drugs that work right away. Buspar takes a few weeks to kick in and supposedly doesn't make you drowsy. It can make you dizzy though, but you can take it in really small doses. Are you able to exercise at all? . It seems to be helping me. . I know how hard it is to get through entertaining events while suffering mentally. Us mothers have such endurance, huh??? I hope you feel better soon. Don't give up! Chris "}, "25": {"a": "27567", "t": "Hi Rashelle, Sorry, this is the last 2 weeks of school around here and things are CRAZY Busy! Let's see. I've increased to 15mg of Prozac and it seems to be better for me. A little more anxious (facial tics - like I had too much caffeine) but other than that OK. I was down a couple of days ago, but when I increased it I felt better within a day. I had no PMS, until the day I got my period, then I felt like I had PMS. Feeling better today though. Still kind of blunted emotionally, but I can laugh. I don't think it's the perfect drug yet, I've felt better in the past, but I really want to give it some more time. I also need to do something about this nonexistent libido though! IT sucks! Maybe if you start from scratch things will work out better. I saw you were talking to someone about Effexor, how about trying that in a small amount? SInce Cymbalta worked on the same neurotransmitters as Effexor maybe you will get a good response. What does your Doctor say? Let me know. Chris "}, "26": {"a": "27567", "t": "HI. Good to hear from you! I'm glad the Zoloft is helping you. Zoloft has not really helped me in the past. I kind of stopped taking the Prozac for a few days to see if my numbness would go away and it kind of did, but I was feeling depressed and unmotivated, so I decided to give the Prozac one last hard try. I'm going to take 10mg/day for a few weeks and maybe even more. I've also added Wellbutrin, which makes me kind of anxious so I think I need the Prozac. Doesn't it suck to not feel excitement/joy? I know what you mean about not feeling that since starting meds because IT's kind of been the same for me. Actually, The Cymbalta was a bit different in that respect. I did feel good things on it. The straight SSRI's I think are maybe more numbing. I don't know I keep thinking about trying Effexor, but I've heard a lot about weight gain and bad side effects when trying to come off, so I really don't want to. Can you relate the beginning of your numbness feelings to any time in your life? I started on meds around 35yrs old after the birth of my second child I felt that stress was overwhelming me. Since then been on the med go round with ups and downs. My children are growing up so fast and I want to enjoy them! Take care and write soon. Glad you had a nice relaxing vacation!

I do not know if I should try the prozac alone...... . or try zoloft...... last time it helped my mood a ton but made me anxious and dizzy.....maybe different this time ?? I am at a loss.

I am on Zoloft now and was feeling good on vacation........... . just little twinges of anxiety........we came home and it is back.....wonder if it is the med/ stressers of working ect or what???? Very frusterating for me. Guess I will have to spend my life laying on the beach to feel good!! My mood is better and all the snapping and yelling is gone!!!

I think that took a lot of courage to do! You know fine that I didnt pull this thread up for any other reason than because you are living proof (as am I) as to how these evil little pills can turn on you. Once, having been the wonderful little pills which helped so much. Many many people in here using them - OK - some have them prescribed by their doctors for legitimate reasons. Many (who may well get them from doctors, who in my book, are downright negligent) take them for no good reason whatsoever - claiming that they help them over a bad patch. Your situation just shows how deadly these drugs can be Thanks james.................... glad to hear you are now doing so well. Hope no further symptoms of withdrawal will rear their nasty ugly wee heads! yinksy "}, "2": {"a": "53525", "t": "Hello Grdian, What you describe are classic symptoms of benzo withdrawal (tinnitus, insomnia, nausea, sickness, tremor, anxiety etc). I know nothing about Wellbutrin - so the symptoms could be produced by either or both drugs? One way to find out would be to take the xanax and if the symptoms disappear then you have your culprit. xanax! If nothing improves then it is the wellbutrin. .25 xanax = 5 mg valium. People taper down off 5 mg valium by way of 1 mg per week. But you have been taking the xanax for only a few weeks? So - hopefully you will be over all this soon? The insomnia is a beast of a thing! I had insomnia for a long time following the departure of benzos - but I had been on ativan for 2 years (a real long time for benzos - and soooooo wrong! I now know). It does improve and you will sleep again normally - but it takes time for the brain cells all to come back on line and working correctly - I am afraid this is something you just have to work through. Dont worry about it - if you can - just take it as it comes to you - one night you will sleep an hour, the next maybe 3 hours ...... . but it will come back. I would urge you not to resort to any of the benzos or ambien or sonata.................... or you risk another addiction. Try sleep hygiene - camomile tea, hot milk before bed..........you know the sort of thing. But above all - dont worry - it may take a day or two or even a week or so............. the brain chemistry has been altered and takes time to correct itself - but it does! In my view the worst things that people seem to do is to throw more pills (chemicals) into the equation - so the brain never gets a chance to sort itself out. Good luck Y "}, "3": {"a": "5891", "t": "Tinninitus wasn't one of my more persistant symptoms as it would come and go. It took a few months for it to totally dissappear, but again, I was not on any drugs at all , so I don't know in your case how long it will last, or if it is Xanax withdrawal induced or if it's the Wellbutrin. As far as your cold, I've had that same sort of thing alot....chances are there is infection in your chest, I would insist on antibiotics when you go in even if the doctor says virus. I can say from experience with bad chest colds, infection is usually there and responds to antibiotics. As mentioned, the Zithromax is excellent. I would be careful about any asthma medication and codiene-based cough syrup your doctor might prescribe.... that's how I first got in trouble with meds and these are both common these days to prescribe for colds. I had reactions to both, the asthma one made me hyper and then the codiene would knock me out; I developed a dependancy on the codiene and had withdrawals, all which was denied by doctors, so my symptoms were medicated with benzos and I was off to worse problems! Skip the asthma med, and substitute over-the-counter Robitusson for the cough medicine. I've done fine on that system with colds since then; my new doctor looked at me funny when I said all I want was antibiotic the last time I had a chest cold, but I told him I do better with over-the-counter cough stuff...too much to explain to him the whole codiene/benzo thing....he probably wouldn't believe it anyway.

I just went to look up more Wellbutrin side effects and was surprised to see fever and flu symptoms listed there in the \"Other Side Effects\" list. Here's the list as a whole: Side Effects of Wellbutrin Side effects cannot be anticipated. If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking Wellbutrin. Seizures are perhaps the most worrisome side effect. Wellbutrin was temporarily removed from the market after its initial release due to the occurrence of seizures in some patients. Although Wellbutrin occasionally causes weight gain, a more common effect is weight loss: Some 28 percent of people who take this medication lose 5 pounds or more. If depression has already caused you to lose weight, and if further weight loss would be detrimental to your health, Wellbutrin may not be the best antidepressant for you. More common side effects may include: Abdominal pain (Wellbutrin SR), agitation, anxiety (Wellbutrin SR), constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, excessive sweating, headache, loss of appetite (Wellbutrin SR), nausea, palpitations (Wellbutrin SR), vomiting, skin rash, sleep disturbances, sore throat (Wellbutrin SR), tremor Other side effects may include: Acne, allergic reactions (severe), bed-wetting, blisters in the mouth and eyes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), blurred vision, breathing difficulty, chest pain, chills, complete or almost complete loss of movement, confusion, dry skin, episodes of over-activity, elation, or irritability, extreme calmness, fatigue, fever, fluid retention, flu-like symptoms, gum irritation and inflammation, hair color changes, hair loss, hives, impotence, incoordination and clumsiness, indigestion, itching, increased libido, menstrual complaints, mood instability, muscle rigidity, painful ejaculation, painful erection, retarded ejaculation, ringing in the ears, sexual dysfunction, suicidal ideation, thirst disturbances, toothache, urinary disturbances, weight gain or loss "}}}, "741781": {"truth": ["diarrhea", "shivering", "mood change", "dizziness", "shaking", "weak", "problem coordination", "difficult breath", "pain arm", "loss memory", "odor bad", "hyperventilation", "heartburn", "dullness", "warm", "tingling", "yellow skin", "congestion ear", "fever", "bleed", "stiffness", "sad", "decrease urine", "fainting", "nose runny", "interest loss", "pain abdominal", "moving difficult", "chill", "sleeping difficult", "neck red", "discouragement", "speech slurred", "problem control muscle", "yellow eye", "clumsiness", "vision blurred", "tiredness", "difficult concentrating", "taste change", "mouth dry", "muscle weak", "forgetful", "swallowing difficult", "voice loss", "sore throat", "twisting uncontrolled movement", "sleepiness", "pleasure loss", "labored breath", "vision double", "nervousness", "dry skin", "constipation", "itch", "pain joint", "prickling", "irregular heartbeat", "sweating", "numb", "trembling", "change menstrual", "behavior change", "arm red", "face red", "stool loose", "move inability eye", "headache", "irritate skin", "change voice", "pain muscle", "speaking difficult", "unsteadiness", "movement uncontrolled twisting", "irritate", "decrease sexual desire", "swell joint", "lightheadedness", "increase appetite", "swell tongue", "tight chest", "confusion", "twitch", "double seeing", "sneezing", "vomit", "menstrual pain", "crawling", "nausea", "loss weight", "chest pain", "vomit bleed", "bloating", "drowsiness", "wheezing", "unsteady walk", "sluggish", "change speech rhythm", "ache body", "difficult urine", "blistering skin", "discomfort", "urine pain", "bowel movement difficult", "skin red", "change speech pattern", "short breath", "pain body", "restlessness", "irritability", "cough", "seizure", "inability move eye", "stomach pain", "bad taste", "loss appetite"], "neat": ["tight chest", "anxiety", "difficult breath"], "umls": ["depression", "pain arm", "difficult breath", "pain body", "pain breast", "discomfort", "heartburn", "attack heart", "chest pain", "stomach cramp", "pain back", "anxiety", "pain leg", "bleed", "tight chest"], "neural": ["bleed", "pain arm", "chest pain", "heartburn", "pain leg"], "doc_content": {"0": {"a": "54384", "t": "Do guys get pressure on just one side of chest??

I also have a serious love for medicine and so I love reading about it. But this is basically how it works, from what I can remember. These virus's can become active in your body for weeks but most of the time it is like resting, unactivated. During the time at which the virus is active, I believe is the time you are contagious. Any sores you have could be contagious to your partner, but those sores will go away. The doctor can even give you medication for this to help speed up the process of healing. Once this virus basically goes back to sleep, you should not be contagious. Now I am not 100% positive if that is how HPV-1 works but you can ask your doctor. I am pretty sure that's the case with all STD's. Unless you have your partner tested for STD's, you really haven't a clue what they might have, so your best best is to practice safe sex with whomever you are involved with.

Whoever you end up with, if they really love you, it'll be okay. The medication that you are taking, alprazolam, is for anxiety. Honestly, it doesn't sound like it's helping you much. It's obvious you are experiencing a high amount of anxiety right now over this whole ordeal. Maybe you should talk to your dr about something different for the anxiety if it doesn't get any better soon and try a sleeping pill for your sleep problems instead of a benzodiazepine.

Also, I haven't been hearing my son call for me in the morning until he's really screaming and upset. That has never happened to me before.

I do not know what to do though, because the Lexapro is working WONDERFULLY for me - except for this orgasm problem I hate to mess around with my meds when this is helping me so much. He also mentioned Cymbalta was a better one with less sexual side affects. Any one tried either of these?

I usually post on pain managment and Fibromyalgia, but I have to agree that people don't really get addicted to their meds. I take Percocet for bt pain, Klonopin for the FM (RLS and to help me sleep) I also take the Duragesic patch 50mcg ( I have a lot of different pain issues, and A LOT of pain), but I've also been down that SSRI road, did the Effexor XR 225mg for nearly two years. I hated it, I hated all the ones I tried. I either had no mood what so ever, or my moods were all over the place. When you have FM they throw those anti-d's at you to help increase your Serotonin level. They give'em to you like candy! I won't ever take another one, too many side effects, and no one told me how hard the wd would be coming off Effexor. So I want to know about this Xanax XR. I have heard that Xanax can also help FM patients. I'm not depressed but I feel anxious a lot. Like your coming out of your skin. I just want to feel calm. I have a new Psyc. and a new Therapist who I think I will like. My other therapist mostly talked about her son and exhusband mistreating her! LOL I thought I was there to talk about me! LOL And my last appt. with my Psyc. was to discuss changing from Klonopin to Xanax so I can take it throughout the day and at night to help me sleep. FM causes you to have very sleepless nights. Or just to use my Klonopin, like I am doing, for night time, cuz I still have the Restless Legs, and use the Xanax as needed when I'm having one of \"those\" days! I feel nauseated a lot of the time, because I can't control my anxiety. I believe we become \"dependent\" on our meds, simply because they offer us a better quality of life. It's like becoming dependent on water or food to survive and give you your basic needs so that you can maintain a good quality of life. But becoming dependent on something that helps us, and becoming addicted are two different things. Becoming addictive, IMO means that you often abuse your meds, run out early, and don't take them for what they were originally intended for. That's addiction, when the drug controls you, you aren't in control of the drug. And yes, your doc is right, those of us who need the meds whether they be benzos or opiates for pain, for a better quality of life usually don't become addicted. We use them responsibly so that we can try to function normally. It's when we begin to abuse them, and let them take control of us is when we get into addiction problems. But yes, by all means, I hope I am dependent on my meds for as long as I need be, just as I am dependent on my husband or my friends to take care of me, or love me, so that I feel human and worthwhile. And, that's my two cents! LOL ? for you all, do you get your Xanax from your PCP or from a Psyciatrist? My rheumy writes my Klonopin but that's because of the FM, and I would rather my Psyc. take over that med, I don't like my rhemy any way!

He said he didn't think I was a druggie at all and knew I was careful with the alprazolam. He said it is very hard to become addicted or build up tolerance to the xanax when you truly have an anxiety disorder. He wanted me to try the effexor for now because of my pmdd issues. He told me last month he didn't really believe in pmdd, but has done more research since he saw me, and said it might help me. So, I feel positive and I know if I don't like it, I can try the xanax xr. Thanks everyone! Oh, also, he is making me an appt. with an endocrenologist (sp?) since my periods are so out of whack. So, we'll see.

Faint lines are still positives. I usually am on alprazolam for anxiety and celexa for depression but once I found out I was pregnant my Dr had me slowly get off of them so I wouldn't have any of the major freak outs as getting off them cold turkey. I have G.A.D. and O.C.D. and depression, yeah I'm a ball of fun fun fun off my meds, however I will tell you that so far that being off my meds has been challenging but with therapy and support I've done fine. My Dr. will be putting me on Zoloft at 34 weeks so that I can hopefully bypass the postpartum depression and still be able to breast feed. I still have anxiety/panic attacks but have found ways to cope with them until I can be medicated again. I think a good support group is key to being able to keep yourself \"sane\" during your pregnancy. My doctor did say if things get really bad then we would go back on the meds but so far so good. It's been a wacky roller coaster but I seem to stay on top of it and not let my crazy out too often. I was on my meds til I was about 6 or 7 weeks.

I haven't taken them in two days now, I had a few close calls but talked myself back. For me, it's a weird rush of negative thoughts and worry, if I jump in the river, I'm in the river, if you know what I mean. If I can keep myself on shore, it passes for the moment, most of the time. Now i know I can't take the anxiety meds, I've tried hard these last two days not to \"go there\" in the my head. Maybe there's an alternative in case I do, I'd have to have a full-blown anxiety attack. But, I'd rather do this without anything for the anxiety. I had the baby blues after my daughter was born in 05, no one ever talked to me about this. In fact, I had no idea why I was so unhappy. This time around, I'll ask for assistance long ahead of the delivery. My daughter wasn't a healthy infant and we nearly lost her, that experience (as my only experience) heightens the value of a stress-free pregnancy this time around. I missed out on a lot. I think I can do this without the meds. Thanks so much for taking the time to answer me. I so appreciate that. "}}}}
