But this is how I suspect it works .... one of the actions of Glucophage is to cut back the amount of glucose the liver produces. If your counter-regulatory system isn't working properly, the effect is that your blood sugar after meals won't rise so high. Which reduces the chances of a hypoglycemic reaction (caused by a weak phase 1 insulin response) some hours later. The result is that blood sugars become more stable, and hypoglycemia is curtailed. I have also found that metformin works for me, in spite of the fact that I am a long-time Type 1 diabetic with no insulin resistance. The mechanism is somewhat different, in that my liver keeps on producing glucose after I start eating because of the time it takes for injected insulin to reach the liver/pancreas (in the presence of insulin, the production of glucagon is shut down, stopping the release of glycogen by the liver). Metformin limits this source of glucose, reducing post-prandial glycemic excursions. For a T1 to use metformin is also unusual and I also get strange looks from doctors and pharmacists!

T2 is where your pancreas is making the insulin but the body doesn't know how to use it to make the food turn into energy, so pills, like Metformin, are given to help the body make the insulin work. Some people that are T2 will sometimes have to take the pills and take insulin because they become insulin resistant. The blood is tested with a glucose meter or through a blood draw at the doctors office and they can tell by the number on the meter if you're a T2 prediabetic or diabetic, and for the T1 it usually comes on after a sickness. It's an autoimmune disorder. Alot of times people will be in what is called Ketoacidosis. It's when the body is using fat for fuel because the pancreas has shut down and isn't making the insulin. Your sugars can be over 300 and even into the 500's. You'll know if this is happening because the best signs are frequent urination and drinking. When my son was diagnosed he was hyperventilating and just wanted to lie down and sleep. Other signs are nausea, hunger, blurred vision, dry skin and the drowsiness. You want to get the person to the hospital ASAP if they're in this state because they could end up in a coma if it's not able to get controlled. My son was in the hospital for a week before they could get his sugars under control. You can be diagnosed with T1 up until you're 30 years old. T2 is generally known as the Adult Onset. It can be controlled with diet changes and weight loss along with the meds. If you had gestational diabetes when you were pregnant that will increase your chances of getting T2 in adulthood.

"}, "1": {"a": "4711", "t": "Apparently there are 2 average ages for getting T1. 12 and about 40. There are 2 tests performed most often to determine if it is type 1 diabetes. One is a GAD antibody test and the other is a c-peptide test. There are a couple of other antibody tests, but GAD is the most common. As T1 is autoimmune, they check to see if your body is trying to attack the insulin producing cells. In conjunction with that a c-peptide levels tells you how much insulin you are producing. Interestingly enough, the c-peptide can help with both diagnoses (T1 and T2). A very high level will indicate insulin resistance, which is typically a characteristic of T2.

I tore the ligaments in my spine(anterior) all the way from the lower sacral to mid-thoracic causing lumbar to go backwards and twist to the right then come forward once I was prone. But the damage was done...herniated 6 disks. Spent a year on my back letting the ligaments heal. But it is slowly going flat and the doc expects the lumbar to go to kyphosis if it hasn't already started. That's why I'm seeing him on Wednesday. Warned me that once he starts fusing my lumbar, he expects to continue until he reaches the neck(however, he also expects to be expanding the neck downwards too). I didn't ask about removing the Harringtons just why they used those as opposed to the regular rods. I guess they just weren't available. Too bad. The newer ones are so much easier to to live with and to change if necessary. They are off the bone so you have some flexion and as a result, the fusions are sturdier. The more inflexible the rods, the more the bone looses calcium and the fusions become weaker over time. I'm watching the same thing happen with my knee implants. They keep showing me the thinning of the bone behind the implants as a way to telling me...revisions are coming.

And yet the shoulder surgeon did all sorts of tests on my neck to make sure it wasn't that but the one thing he didn't do...an MRI. Just the shoulders. No one, not even my rheumatologist who had been seeing me for 12 years knew I had a bad neck. He knew I had herniated one disk but not 4 of them. And when my legs got so stiff I could only take baby steps, he sent me to the doc who replaced my knees and he asked if I had neck problems...no, I said. It was only when I lifted one too many shovelfuls of snow and went numb from the neck down that I realized I had a problem and asked my rheumy to do the MRI. Everyone was shocked. Neurologist got me into major spine doc in Boston and off I went. Even he got me in after only 3 weeks when the normal wait is 6 months. I was in surgery in less than 4 weeks. But when the ligaments tore again 3 months after surgery and I subluxated 5 vertebrae and broke 3 of the bone grafts, I went to a local ER and they didn't know what a laminoplasty was and told me all I had was muscle spasms and sent me home with Valium. Waited 2 days(of course this happened on a Friday night) and called the neurosurgeon....gone for 2 weeks....so I tried another local ER at a bigger hospital. They added MS Contin to the Valium. Neither place even bothered to take an x-ray. Saw doc the day he got back and all he did was take 2 x-rays and ask me to try to hold up my head(I couldn't and by this time could hardly walk) and said I had post-laminoplasty kyphosis and needed immediate surgery. That was before he did a CT and found the broken grafts and that one had fallen into the canal and impaled my cord.

I said first he needs to get an MRI done. He was going thru therapy at the time and the therapy wasn't helping. I said after the MRI is done it will show that the problem was stemming from problems in the cervical area NOT the shoulder. When they finally did the MRI what did it show?

There are times when I go to see a doctor and the minute he/she walks in sometimes I sense this doc is going to be trouble. A few years ago I was referred over to a surgeon. There was concern that I had pancreatic cancer. The surgeon that I went to see the minute he walked in I thought uh oh somethings not right. My 6th sense kicked in. He recommended that NO surgery be done on the pancrease. Well I went back to the gastro doc that referred me to the surgeon. He disagreed that nothing should be done. He felt if it was cancer better deal with it now rather then later. So I went to a different doc and he agreed surgery had to be done. If nothing was done I probably wouldnt be here. The first doc at one point wanted a CT with contrast done on me. But I have trouble with contrast and the radiology dept was hesitating touching me because of the kidney issues. So the first doc who only saw me for 10 minutes tells them to do an MRI on me. I cant have an MRI because of an implant in back.

Pls help. "}, "1": {"a": "1698", "t": "Hello there, thanks for reply 92261. Well, yes my husband is an adult of 30 years but unfortunately talking about his health, he is like a little child, he doesn't take any care at all, he doesn't use never his glucose monitor machine, he doesn't follow nothing, and he doesn't care about his health. He was diagnosed 8 years ago type 2 diabetic, so the doctor put him under pills but since he didn't take care of his bad habbits of foods his type 2 diabetes turn into type 1 diabetes so the doctor put him in insulin shots and no more pills. his Ac1 last month results showed 10% and he was like happy saying \"ohh look 10% !!! usually before it was at 12% and 13% but now is 10%\" it lower a bit because I insist to him to use his insulin shots more often, 2 times per day at least, 3 months ago. So, yes is kind of hard to keep him controlled but lately I have change all his meals, putting more amount of low carb food and less amount of high carb foods, for example, in breakfast I can give to him: * eggs * sausage * bacon * 1 or 2 slices of bread with peanut butter * low carb juice For Lunch I''m giving him: * fresh salad * 2 or 3 smashed potatoes * meat (usually white without skin) For Dinner I'm giving him: * fish * fresh salad with mayo * 1 or 2 slice of bread with cheese Those are examples, but mostly I'm trying to reduce high carb food from all his meals, if I give him rice I give him 2 big spoon of rice and plenty of veggies. I also think he is already celiac, because if he drinks milk, or soda or eat yogurt in less than 1 hours he's already in the bathroom with very bad stomach. My husband doesn't exercise at all (in fact when he's not at work, he wants only to eat and straight go to bed to sleep) is very very lazy in that aspect. I am the one who's on the Gym, and eating plenty of fruits and I am not diabetic. He smoke, I don't see him smoking because he do it when I'm not home or when I'm sleeping, I only wake up and see the rest of the cigarrette outside the apartment and I know is him. Also since he lovesssssssss to eat a lot, he goes outside hiding from me, and buy some pizza or more bread, so when he gets home I argue with him. His dietician was gonna sign to make his insurance stop providing him insulin medications I remember, and my husband desperate 2 weeks before his appointment start to monitor his sugar 3 times per day with the glucose machine, start to eat only salad and white meat, so his blood sugar was \"controlled\" but after the appointment when he saw that the dietician didn't sign to make his insurance to stop providing him his insulin medication, bang he did went back to his bad habits and also he stop using the glucose monitor. He only goes in \"control\" when he knows he's gonna have an appointment with his dietician, and that is like 1 time per year. I just want to try to lower his Ac1 since 10% is very high even if he was celebrating, but is not good. I know I'm not going to be able to make him use more shots of insulin, but at least I want to try to lower his insulin demand through the day, since he already has plenty of damaged on his body and I don't want to loose him. "}, "2": {"a": "1698", "t": "Hi Ruth. Thanks a lot for reply. Definetely the problem with my husband is that he doesn,t care at all he just wants to live a normal life like a normal person. He takes 1 single shot of insulin per day, I don,t know the amount of insulin he takes but, he does mix both fast and slow together, and sometimes it pass more than 24 hours before he takes another shot. I talk to him sometimes about this, why he doesn,t care and he refuses to talk about it and gets mad, I think that he just don,t like to take shots cause each time he is going to put his 1 single shot per day he start to complain about it, and later he wants to eat plenty of high carb foods. Sometimes he argue with me because I don,t give him rice or cake or bread, instead I give him salad and fish and when he ask if there something else to eat, I answer no, there isn,t there,s only salad for you. He has diabetic foot and I bought to him special shoes for diabetic people to help him with this issue, at start he didn,t want to use the shoes. . after a big argue with him, he finally start to use the shoes and now those are his daily shoes, I would like to buy him a pump but I,m affraid that probably he wouln,t use it I don,t care about putting my money on things I know could help him, the thing is if he will use it or not. I know if this continue the way it is, he is not going to live more than 10 years and is sad for me to see him killing himself this way when he could be helping himself. Soon is his birthday (on November 13) I,m going to buy a pump for him as a gift hoping in god that he decides to use it, and if you can recommend to me which pump is good, I read about Omnipod that doesn,t have any cord or cable (maybe this one will fit my husband since probably he don,t want to use some machine with some cable attached to it) or Medtronic. Meanwhile I,m going to still keeping his meals with less high carb foods. I,m sorry I cannot make him come to this board since he doesn,t know english at all, and I,m sorry for asking for help for someone that just doesn,t care at all about his health is just that I want to try to request all the help I can with my limitations with him, I will keep you update about the future pump I will give him...and god please help me with this. Regards. "}, "3": {"a": "1698", "t": "Hello Ruth. With pain in my heart, I do know you're right. I love him, I don't want anything bad to happen to him, but in the other hand he's an adult and I cannot force him to take care of himself even if I try the last decision is from him, which sometimes desperates me and get me sad because I know diabetes can lead to terrible things if not taking care of. It will be useless for me to buy him a pump right now, since he's gonna think that the pump is a pancreas and that he will be more free to eat whatever he wants without any worries and a pump is not that. He already has plenty of things, he even has hard time to sleep since he spent lot of time in bed with spasm on his legs and body, and he had become very weak from stomach cause everyday he has diarrhea with anything he eats like milk, water or even bread but he just don't stop he continues with this bad habbit. Anyway, I want to thank you for giving me some recommendations on him, is going to be a sad long road for me and is hard to see someone killing himself and just don,t care about it. "}, "4": {"a": "1698", "t": "Hi 92261 Thanks for your concern. I'm not very sure what type of diabetic my husband has...I said type 1 because he needs to use insulin shots, but he told me that at first he was type 2 and the doctors give him pills to try to lower his blood sugar, but he told me that pills didn't work or something like that and finally the doctor change the pills for insulin shots, but I'm very sorry I cannot confirm exactly what kind of diabetic he has since he doesn't speak of it to me and avoid to speak about it too. His father also is diabetic (but his father control his diabetic with pills) his mother also was diabetic too (but she used to keep it under control with pills too) his mother died recently of a massive stroke, unfortunately there where nothing doctors can do for her. I don't live in US, I live in Chile and here insurance don't cover pump they only cover insulin and pills. I did find out that pump are very expensive here (not that I wouldn't paid for it, if I knew my husband will really take care of himself I won't mind at all to buy the pump and paid monthly for the POD). But, probably if I buy a pump he will leave it there in the coach. He has his diabetic foot and I force him to went to a foot care doctor 1 month ago, he did, and now both feet are way much better, he needs to go to the foot doctor every 2 months to keep it this way. Yesterday night I prepare for dinner a big plate of fresh salad with fish, he eat it all and went out to buy a big bar of chocolate after saying that he was hungry later like 25 minutes after he ate the chocolate, went straight to the bathroom with diarrhea. His family argue a lot with him because they also push him to take more care about himself, his reaction is the same as with me, the \"leave me alone\" reaction...I will keep update here, he's too young to suffer all this things and he just don't listen. I'm gonna keep trying to find the way to make him take more care of himself, but is very hard I must say. "}, "5": {"a": "1698", "t": "hello 92261 This was funny lol, but is true. I'm gonna ask my husband if his body produces or not insulin at all, and since both of his parents are/were type 2 diabetes, is very probably my husband is type 2 too (sorry if I confused the type of diabetes) he said to me that when he got diagnosed like 8 years ago it was type 2 but pills didn't work for him, so that's why he is with insulin shots (I though all my life that people who needed insulin shots were type 1 diabetes only). I know in type 1 pancreas doesn't produce any insulin at all or to few for the body to use it, this condition I do know is not for eating \"sugar\" like most people think, in case of my husband since he loves too much to eat fast food, he probably is type 2 after all, but I will confirm it with him. He doesn't do any exercise at all, in fact he even hates to walk 2 blocks unless is extremely necessary, he's very very lazy in this aspect, he only goes from work (and in work he spent full day on a chair), from bed, eat and instantly to bed again. I still prepare healthy meals for him, no matter if he goes outside and buy bread or chocolate. I bought for him iodine and Spirulina pills 2 days ago, he has started to take them (but he still using only 1 shot per day of insulin and eating junk food when I'm not around) I recently discover iodine tend to open body receptor cells so the body start to use the rejected insulin that people with type 2 diabetes ignore, so this may probably help him to lower a bit his blood glucose, at least for me, iodine pills gave me hypoclicemia because my blood glucose are not so high but in the case of my husband were his blood glucose are far up 200++ this maybe can help him. He seems kind of happy with the \"pills\" and with the healthy meals, even if he still eats junk outside but he's starting to reduce the amount of junk food so something is something, I will try to keep improving with him.

My liver is making sugar and from what I understood diet could not really remedy that. And yes, my doctor noted that every time I hit a high bg my pancreas was taking a hit. And I dread going on insulin more than I dread meds. Also, my husband who seems to have a better undestanding of Type II than I do noted that if I did ever wind up going on insulin, it'd be like adding fuel to the fire...b/c I'm already insulin resistant, so I'd need a much higher dose of insulin than say someone with Type I diabetes. So I really want to avoid insulin as much as I can. The last time I had my A1C checked back in February it was 5.4 which was normal. Also at that time my fasting bg during my 3 hour oral glucose tolerance test was 99 (high end of normal). It was my 2 hour level of 201 that resulted in the Type II diagnosis. Since then I've been checking my post meal glucoses which generally range between 100-110 (low carb meals), I'd go up to around 125 with complex carbs and with refined carbs I generally went up to 140.

Then he will thank me for never being a boring patient. i always bring him something new. Last time was the hypoadrenalism. .

Right now my cat comes to the door and paws under it or meows at me. She likes to visit when people are in the bathroom. I think it has to do with having a captivated audience. My 70 lb border collie does the same thing when he gets a chance. Except he likes to drop his big head in your lap and stare at you. Disturbing to say the least. The sweating palms and palpatations can be due to a suppresed adrenal response just as readily as hyperthyroidism. But we do know that the thyroid and its hormone production is cyclical. Have you increased your iodine intake? Caffiene? What are your new medications again? Do you think one is interfering with the absorption of your T3? I AM glad that your palms are healing. I am not glad that you are having palps/tachycardia issues. There is no telling how that cortisol shot has temporarily whacked your adrenal production. When you have too much cortisol dumped in you can cause excess pregnenolone to be funneled into progesterone -> DHEA -> estrogen and testosterone. The adrenal production line is more complex than that of the thyroid. You may be feeling the belated effects of one more unnecessary cortisol shot pleasure. I wish I could take the symptoms for you for a bit. My hands and feet are DRY! Desert dry! My 20&#37; FT4 level and 53% FT3 level just don't meet my physical needs. So I get to up my levels a tidbit more while my system gets back on the 15-20 mcgs of HC a day. 10 mcgs wasn't cutting it. I still recommend my cardiologist if you ever have to shop for one. My cardiologist is GREAT! Sorry, I love the guy. He is SOOOooo logical and thorough. He was disgusted with the Endo's findings and lack of insight. He picked up on the PCOS from the stim test and stated that was the only value to the test given I was only off HC for 2 weeks. He knew that you had to be off HC for 4 weeks to perform valid ACTH stim tests. Why didn't the Endo? Humm? *snort* My Cardio made sure to stress that he wasn't and endocrinologist, but he had a best friend in Boston that went through Hashi's and hypothyroidism treatment during medical school. He also let me know that he dealt with the heart issues too long un-under treated thyroid issues cause. It was a chore and made him very attune to thyroid conditions. I let him know not being an Endo seems to be a plus for thyroid care. He told me to disregard the unsubstantiated advice of a certain Endo and stay on the hydrocortisone and synthroid no matter what. He would write the script if my other MDs refused too! He also told me that I needed to start a glucofauge(sp) like metaformin(sp) to control the rective hypoglycemia and help with my weight retention. Adding the GF would only improve my overall symptoms and health. My blood work and symptom logs have proven that we are on the right track, in his opinion. Why? Well my BP is now holding at 110-120 over 60-80. In his office after a brief stress test my BP held at (116/65)! YEAH! In addition my heart rate is down from 100 - 120 beats a minute to 70 beats a minute. This would never have occured without taking HC and T4. Here comes the logic of a MD with common sense. If I didn't need my T4 supplement my heart issues (palpatations, tachycardia, and a few other nasties) would have amplified with addition of 25, 50, or 75 mcgs of T4... right now I am on 88 mcgs! Instead my heart is HAPPY and chilling, thus I need T4 supplementation. This also supports that my heart issues were the result of insufficient thyroid hormone to regulate my physical functions and reduce AI attack of my systems. Thyroid supplementation alone was not controlling my heart issues. I was having to add pindolol a beta blocker. I was still having break through palps and a racing heart rate. My BP was border line hypertensive on occasion as well. Then my hypoadrenalism was found and treated. My heart rate and BP dropped and stabilized again, I was also able to cut my pindolol dosage in half! The two weeks off the HC, BP and HR spiked and my pindolol dosage doubled. These findings are experimental support that HC was/is needed by my system. Also logic dictates, if my body was not deficient in HC addition of 20 mg would cause Cushings symptoms as well as make my heart rate and BP worse. No indications of Cushings and heart issues are detectable on the HC. Thu my MD gave me his logic summary, the pure fact that as soon as I started synthroid my heart issues got better, and as soon as I started my HC my heart issues improved even more implies that I was and am in need both T4 and HC. A thinking MD! WE NEED A PLAQUE, A RIBBON, AN AWARD>>> THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, COMMON SENSE AWARD! Needless to say it was my heart physical day yesterday. My heart is doing 10x better than before my endocrine system decided to crash. Why because I found an IM willing to listen to my symptoms and body and treat me accordingly. My Cardio is going to call about in the Brigham Young and Mayo clinics in an attempt to find an MD that might want me and my family to study. He wants me to have the RIGHT Endo for me. Isn't that sweet? Given the new PCOS and insulin resistance and hypoglycemia development, he is certain my endocrine dysfunction is genetic. I told him given my mom and her sisters (her mom, cousin, aunt, grandma, great aunt) and my dad's Aunts and female Cousins and mother having issues, I am certain it is genetic as well and I have a perfect familial set to study. Now we just have to find an MD that is willing to study us. Do you have a large enough family set to study? How many more days til you see your oncologist? I am really hoping that he is logical and competent. I hope that your thumper takes a chill pill soon and that things improve quickly. My weight is holding at the 4.5 pound loss.

MG "}, "11": {"a": "4333", "t": "GG, Well not sure what is up with the link. But funny stuff happens in Cyber land. As to the bones are the right lenght for his age. . well are they the right length for him? Has he had a steady depression or fall through the growth range as time progressed, My son was ignored because he fell from the 125&#37; of normal range to 30% of normal growth rate. Well excuse me? I would think a large child that was consistantly above range suddenly plunging almost 100% should be noteworthy. My MD said he is still growing. Technically he was not. He was still normal in range and had a positive growth rate, but only because he had been so large and up in the scale initially. His growth suppression and stall was the result of sleep apnea. We put him on a CPAP and he is now at 125% for his head size (This never changed he has a charlie brown noggin) and his body is back to 95% on the normal scale. We watch his sleep efficiency like a hawk and are following it aggressively. While this example is sleep apnea in nature, the same thing can happen to a child with a slow failing thyroid. As T4 and T3 levels drop the rate of growth will slow/stall. The child may stay in normal range for a year or two before falling below range and triggering the red flag for most MDs. As you know we tend to have to press our own cases. I can not say one way or another on your nephew with out the appropriate blood work to ramble through. Why are you classified as Graves? With your TGAB and TPOAb levels you are like me Hashimoto's with a side order of Graves. I was TPOAb 1650 (<35), TGAb 200 (<30), TSI 110, my TRAb was negligible. TPOAb ad TGAb are the Hashimoto's identifiers while TSI and TRAb are the Graves identifiers. Your T3 levels are high and T4 levels normal? T3 toxicosis. research shows this is very common in Hashimoto's. in Graves most have HIGH T4 and HIGH T3. Have your MDs ever (tested for / ruled out) hypoadrenalism? How about reactive hypoglycemia? Both can cause many of the Graves symptoms. I have some Graves issues like mild thyroid eye disease, tachycardia, palpitations, prehypertension. I am on a beta-blocker, magnesium, and super B complex to combat these symptoms and a reactive steriod regime for eye flares and symptoms. I do not know how much longer I will be on the betas. My thyroid is dying at a decent rate; and since starting my glucophauge for my insulin resistance and reactive hypoglycemia, my BP has been steadily dropping. Yesterday my BP was 106 / 65 and 115 / 75. It was still good this morning. My HR is sitting steady in the 70's. My IM and cardiologist are chuckling and patting themselves on the back. My Cardiologist wants me to hold on the betas for a bit longer. All, My MDs say I am a living adventure in classic blood work diagnosis and positive blood work and symptom response as soon as the right meds are started. The right tests need to be run and look at in conjunction with symptoms, but so far my blood and treatment reaction has been spot on. Each new med has helped alleviate my symptoms and issues. Synthroid dropped my HR and BP and help with BT regulation and other hypothyroid issues. Adrenal meds took out the fatigue and constant urge to sleep and reduced my heart issues further. The also got my T4 and T3 levels balanced in range, by suppressing my T4 to T3 conversion. Now the glucophage has seriously reduced joint ache and pain and muscle fatigue and cramping. Now I am down to waiting on my OB to schedule an Ovary Ultrasound for final PCOS diagnosis. I have every blood work marker, now they want the physical one. I really wish the MDs were more forward thinking as a whole. As to my last meeting with my MD for dietary management of my insulin resistance and hypoglycemia. I was told I needed to think more like a carnivore. I am supposed to eat 3 oz of meat every 2-3 hours and minimize corn, potatoes, pasta, white bread, straight sugar. . stick to smaller portions of fruit and veggies. The food allergies like wheat made the nutricionist RN groan. I had my boy with me and he talked with all the staff and MDs. When we were leaving they told him, \"It was nice to meet you!\" My son replied with a real hammer blow of embarrassment. He looked at them all and said with a REAL big smile, \"I know.\" Paused when the others laughed at my gapping mouth and shocked expression. \"I am really smart and cute!\" Well He fails the modesty and manners test. BUT everyone enjoyed him. *snort* I hope that you all have had a nice week end. MG "}, "12": {"a": "4333", "t": "Dang it! Honesty does have its good points. IF he writes you a letter saying that he is unable to meet your needs will tricare let you go to the other MD? Insurance companies can be a royal PAIN. My mom told me her MD told her that Tricare only allowed for a thyroid panel to be drawn ONCE a year! I know that is bull FLOP! But she believes it. It may take me 3-6 months to get her to believe it. Well DANG that just sucks all around. I am sorry that you are still on the road to the unknown. MG "}, "13": {"a": "4333", "t": "GG, Yes. My mother, Aunt B1, and I have Hashitoxicosis. Hashi's and Graves. My Hashi's dominates me. My mom and her sister were Graves dominant. My Aunt B spent 13 years on a thyroid roller coaster. Meds couldn't do it. Then they said RAI the thing. Well that ****** her thyroid off. So RAI again... thyroid was still fighting back. When the MD started to say RAI 3. . well he was told only a TT will be considered. She only got relief by removing the aggravant source. My mom had one lobe HOT I mean HOT and the other lobe dead as a door nail and Hashi's pulverised. The dead node had papillary cancer making itself known as well. So she had a PT to remove the dead half and they left the hyper Half to cover her needs. It has been ten years. Now her remaining half has succumbed to Hashimoto's. I was having flares I would have a week or two hyper and then a week or two hypoT with a normal transistion week in between. It sucked. My antibody levels reached 2000+ I have no idea how high they may have gotten, but my TSI are steady freddy at 110-120. It is suspected that the constant high T3 levels resulted in my adrenal glands burning out due to over work. Have your MDs looked at your adrenal function lately? ACTH and Cortisol? If your adrenal function is taxed and you are not making enough cortisol, then your T3 Toxicosis will be amplified. It is possible that your MDs have been ignoring the Hashimoto's because you are still in the hyper phase. What treatment you should pursue is up to you and your MDs. I can only share my families experience and my opinion. I would love to have my pain in the neck removed. At this time my MDs are not on board with that choice. Time will tell. MG "}, "14": {"a": "4333", "t": "Helen, That is a wierd set of results that should have an MD worth his salt wanting to investigate. I know when I am pressed with the unknown, it makes me search for the answers. It looks like the cytomel is doing the trick for you. This is good. The iron saturation being low given good ferritin and total iron levels is odd. By low iron saturation, do you mean transferrin saturation? Transferrin is a protein molecule (as you know I am sure) in the blood that transports iron and controls the amounts and where iron is in the body. Low Transferrin saturation can produce iron deficiency anemia if prolonged. Have you reduced your fat and protien intake of late? If you have reduced red meats lately then you probably have also reduced the necessary protien fuel for transferrin synthesis and iron content maintanence. If this is the case you should at least supplement with 30-40 mg of ferrous fumarate. Four cooked ounces of lean red meats, poultry and fish that are good sources of protein should fulfill your protein needs along with 2 cups of skim milk daily. This is straight from my enhance the carnivor pre-diabetes nutrician stuff. Lean red meat is preferred in the case of iron deficient patients. A 3 - 4 ounce piece of meat should be as big as the back of your hand and as thick as your little finger. I am still working out the sunflower seed replacement method. Keeping a balanced diet is a chore. Seeing a nutritionist may be a good thing for you. Following their instructions explicitly. . something all together different. Well I have 6 pounds set aside for you to claim. Just come and get 'em! It is amazing what little things like what you eat and drink can do to you. Now I got through the initial loose stool side effect of the glucophage. Things are settling out. I have noticed that if I eat sugar/white bread/pasta that I am almost guaranteed to get the back door trots. If I stick to the fruit, veggies, and meat, I am good. *snort* I have to dig into the mechanism of metformin. On the up or downside. . not sure which. I believe I officially ovulated. MAN did it hurt. I normally would get mild cramps and maybe spotting on the 13-15 days of my cycle, pre-metformin. This month I about curled up in a ball and begged for mercy. They are supposed to get back to me with my ovary US appointment time today. Ugh! Not looking forward to that one. I need to breakdown and ask my SIL for the other treatments of PCOS. All in all I like the metaformin ER. It is helping. Now I just need a nap and some sugar. I MISS SUGAR! *shuffles off to pout and stare at some guys drinking sodas and eating donuts* MG "}, "15": {"a": "4333", "t": "Helen, The only time I have met MDs in a hurry is when they have been tripple booked... or they are trying to finish your C-section to move on to the next cow in line... Uh? That works. MDs that care and take time are a rare breed, but then they are still being pulled in every direction at once. The only MD that is going to fixate on a specific rare issue is one that has close dealings with it. . i.e. they suffer fromit themselves or have a loved one that sufferers from it. My SIL sees around 30 patients a day and spends long days covering all their needs and has gotten great RNs and PAs to assist her. She does research for her special cases, takes care of her premature son that is riddled with continual sinus and ear infections, and just can not follow each of her special cases with the diligence we can. She does get her patients under control and properly tested, before sending them off to a specialist with a recommendation. Still this will only be effetive iff each patient is willing to go to bat for themselves. You, HELEN, are a major league slugger. Keep on swinging and knocking those MD balls out of the park. Maybe one day a homerun will actually win te game for you. . *shivers* Dang! I went on a BBall rant. I am getting a bad taste in my mouth. Ugh! You get the picture. You are great, and you help a LOT of people. I can not wait for you to get your PAs license! You will really be a bug up the backside of the local MD market. I wish that your hands and feet had recovered by now. The dermatologist was wrong in his treatment. As the patient with no MD you are not to blame for a period of weakness allowing the MD to try and treat you. The cortisol shot mucks with your immune system weakening it. Given the low IgG you were almost guaranteed to get a sinus infection. I think you are right that you need to work on the sugar issues and keep plugging at the thyroid. Now is it an issue with the actual pituitary gland OR the communication loop between the liver, hypothalamus, pituitary gland that is causing the TR. Being resistant to TSH is definitely an unusual phenomena. Mechanistically it is fascinating. I am sure it is not fun to live with. I can not even follow all that is tumbling down with me. . but it looks like endocrine dominos. My son can not get upset too much and cry and all that, with his low IgA and IgG he gets sinus infections if the cat sneezes... BUT he has no allergies except to DPaT. He has vasomotor rhinitis and reacts POORLY to pollutants. when restraunts were still smoking, we could go to them. We couldn't take him to my Grandma's home because she smoked and walking through the door set him off. He is one more odd ball in the family. *snort* Like I can talk queen of five endocrine disorders now??? Humm. . Hashimoto's, hypoadrenal, PCOS/insulin resistance, reactive hypoglycemia, Graves, Thyroid Eye Disease, subclinical hypothyroid, eewwweee.... Okay six. . I lump Hashi's/hypoT together and PCOS/insulin res together. I still haven't figured out if PCOS and IR are the same thing from different eras or different. There are mixed reviews on it. I think they are different, but not going to state it as fact yet. I hope that the diabetes educator can fix things for you, but I think you are going to need some form of sugar management. My son finally figured out why we make him wash his hands after playing in the fish tank. The revelation was classic. My son comes out of the bathroom and looks at me and asks,\" Mom where do fish poop and pee? \" I of course said, \"In the water.\" There was a pause followed by an \"EEEEWWWWWEEEEEE! BUT MOM they eat and swin=m and breathe in that water.\" I nodded sagely and my son now tries to get them to jump out of the water to nibble in his finger/hand. Now another point here. . do all males think best in the bathroom. My son and hubby always come out of a think tank session with ideas to try. My hubby insists his best work is done in the bathroom. *snort* I try to relax in the bathroom. It is my get away zone. Ah! Squirrels. Cute, fluffy tailed, nut loving, wire chewing, house and fence eating, psyho RATS! Man they are characters. Other than Rocky, most squirrels are critters to beware of... I have had them run up my leg on campous and us my shoulder as a spring board. . then there is one (fox squirrel) that lays in wait and will charge me and still my apple core out of my hand. I can picture those squirrels stealing your hubby's nuts. . Uh. . that sounds wrong. In MS at the barn with the horses we had a field with pecan trees in it. The squirrels were masters at gathering the good nuts and leaving the rotten ones. If we didn't have a tree shaker and catch the nuts as they were falling. . we were left with only bad nuts. I used to love hazel nuts and Walnuts. I am allergic to most tree nuts now. It sucks. Pine nuts and pecans are the worst for me. At least I can eat peanut butter. My grandma had a tame grey squirrel that would ride her cat's back. The cact didn't like it, but I think he learned to respect the little claws and big teeth of the squirrel. And my in-Laws have squirrels that keep eating through their cedar siding into their attic and making nests out of their phone, TV, and internet cables. The only thing that worked to keep them away was wolf urine. We ordered it and put sawdust pellets in a pantyhose pocket soaked in the solution. It was messy, but the thought of a wolf in the attic sent them scurry to a safer nesting zone. We tried the hunt and destroy tactic for the squirrels, but they are quick and we didn't want to shoot up the attic. It is cold down here as well. I have boosted my T4 meds with my MDs go ahead. I get to add another 12.5 mcgs. She wants me to slowly crawl up given my last hypo to hyper episode jumping 25 mcgs to 75. Well it only took 2.5 months for the hypoerT phase to pass and for me to need more T4. I hope that things get better soon and that we ALL find the source of our issues. I am certian it is just bad genes in my case. I hope my son choses a wife that is endocrinologically sound. Maybe we can still breed my issues out. Keep your head up and don't stop that researching of yours. Good luck. MG "}, "16": {"a": "4333", "t": "All I can say is we are both wierd in the biochemistry department. Well we could definitely confuse some MDS and students. You could see if you can enlist as medical mystery 101 diagnostic specimen for various medical schools... that would be enlightening. Maybe if the MD treating us was getting a grade out of the deal. . they would be more thorough. Hummm? Food for thought. Some times a closer look can be unpleasant. I had my PCOS confirming Uterine ultrasound. The probe was SCARY. It was also very unpleasant. I was glad only women were around. I am working up to my monthly visitor. Any day now. . last night was horrid. I kept getting woken up with killer abdominal cramps. I need to look into how metformin effects the ole menstrual cycle. OUCH! I am dragging today. I was up til 3 am waiting for the ccramps to subside. I got. . Ugh. . less than four hours sleep last night.

I'm so tired of all these guys with these big fancy degrees and all this schooling who don't know jack s--- when it comes to anything out of the ordinary. Is it a money thing? They don't get paid to research or even think??? It seems any more that the whole system has turned into a money machine and anything that sticks in the cogs gets tossed aside. I'm glad the metaform seems to be working for you. That's the other thing I'm in need of. A dietician. The gp mentioned it about 6 mos ago but never set anything up. I'm trying so hard and blowing it so completely. I can't find that magic mix that keeps the sugar down without shedding the pounds. I'm spending so much time putting out fires that I can't seem to enjoy anything anymore. It's becoming a struggle to find anything to eat and everything I eat is controlled by that damned meter. I hate it. I already sent him a link to my hands. Never heard back from him. I use salt packs for abscesses. They work wonders but pouring salt on an open wound??? The woman got a masochistic streak in her? Ouch!!!!! Six is a big step. That's about the time they start turning into real people. I like six year olds. Did I tell ya my 8yr old step gd is coming to visit the end of the month for the weekend? We haven't met her yet. I can't wait. We used to have her dad in the summers and he was a great kid. From all I've heard, she's a lot like him. They're both coming. Haven't seen him since he was 18. That was 14yrs ago. We used to get along so well but he grew up and grew off. I hope this is the beginning of a close family again. For now I'm just going to ignore the foot. Get thru this next appt with the \"specialist\" and figure out where to go from there. Only a week to go. I hope he's brilliant. I can dream, can't I? "}, "18": {"a": "16321", "t": "Yep, wednesday got here. Have you noticed how big they're growing kids now? I don't think it's my imagination either. When I was young, I may have been small but I really don't remember looking up so high at so many. Now it's like all the kids out there tower over me. My youngest sister who's only 5' went to the doctor when she was 18. He said at that point it was too late to do anything about it. She was crushed. I don't think she's ever realized that size doesn't really matter. And your response to let's see what the labs say shoulda been \"and don't it matter how I feel?\" . Did you tell him you felt pretty good? Achy in the joints can be a lot of things. We older gals do have a bit of wear and tear to take into consideration whenever trying to assess something like that. I have my two tylenol rule. If two tylenol help, then it probably ain't too serious. I don't like to take large amounts of tylenol though and I never found anti-inflammatories to help much. The gp keeps me supplied with small amounts of codeine. Just enough to take the edge off but not enough to get me in trouble. I've had this arthritis for 25 yrs and am finally living pretty comfortably with it. Did you have those antibodies tested before? Some docs look at them for trends to see if a person has or is likely to go into remission. It would be terribly interesting to see what your's have done. They're all in a rush nowadays but it's nice having someone who remembers things. Your's sounds like a lot of fun to watch. Does he have a good sense of humor? My gp and I kinda play a game to see who can remember the lab numbers before he looks in the chart to verify. A lot of the times we come up with the same. He says his nurses hate the way he can remember things like that. I think that's only cause they're so dumb though and resent anyone who knows anything. I started in august. Going back to school was a big decision. I'm only taking one class this term to test the waters but now I think I'm ready to jump in with both feet. I'm going to be able to do the whole thing, except the externships and clinicals, online. I'll be doing those with my gp and the local hospital here. The reason I'm going this route is cause I do want to be able to do research and by becoming an advocate on top of it, I'll have the credentials to be able to focus on those who really need someone to help get em thru.

He did draw another iron panel just in case things had changed and I was iron deficient afterall but he seriously doubted it. He also said he'd have the hospital look at a smear cause of the odd size rbc's and all and I could come back in two weeks for the results but that was all he could do and he was sorry.

He wants to keep the thyroid levels right where they're at with the low normal TSH, midrange T4 and high T3. Since the symptoms are under control at that level, he doesn't want to muck with it. He says he believes in treating the patient, not the labs. I get to keep my cytomel and I get to keep my sanity. The crazy experiment worked. He hadn't gotten a report from the oncologist yet but said he'd like to wait and see what he has to say before doing anything else. He mentioned that a lot of times doctors will tell doctors a lot more than they tell the patient. We'll see. I did get the onc's office to fax me a copy of the labs yesterday. Excellent iron and ferritin levels but the TIBC is high and the iron saturation's low. The smear shows some anisopoikilocytosis again (that's variation in size and shape of the rbc's) and a relative shift towards lymphocytes in the wbc differential. The monocytes were quite high. I'm guessing that the shift and the monos might be from the shingles. I'd gotten that 3 weeks before the labs were drawn. Still the wbc count itself seems way too low for having an infection that's bad enough to mess that much with the differentials. It just doesn't make sense. Oh, he is going to do a heavy metals screen just in case. Anyhows, next stop is the diabetes educator. I see her on the 6th to go over the diet and evaluate the insulin needs. The gp says she's really good and shall get me on track based on my lifestyle and will spend as much time with me as I need. I reached the end of my rope on that last week when I couldn't remember how to sign my name so I checked the sugar and it was 249. That was from 22 carbs. I've hardly touched a carb since then and my heads been clearer than it's been in a long time.

Thank you. He's a good doctor. Gutsy too. I sure couldn't get the endos to try giving a hyper extra thryoid hormones. He's the only one who sat down and actually read up on it. The treatment protocol is beta blockers and T3 or whatever to suppress the pituitary. He's my hero. mg, They call it iron saturation but yeah, it's tranferrin saturation. The TIBC (which translates to the same as transferrin) is 503 (265-497). The iron saturation is 12%. 20's considered low. No, low iron transferrin saturation does not cause iron deficiency anemia. If the iron or ferritin levels are on the low end, it says that iron deficency is probably pending. All it really says for me is the transferrin level is too high. Since the iron and ferritin levels are so good, something is raising the transferrin level. No, I've increased my fat and protein. Part of the diabetic diet that I've been on for the last year. Unlimited meat and fat as long as I keep my HDL at 60. It's the carbs that have been restricted. I was taken off venison and put on beef for the extra fat content. Thighs instead of breasts. You know, all the stuff that's supposed to be bad for you but tastes so terribly good. The 3/4lb t-bone last night was delicious. I woulda rather had a whole potato than just half of one but the cheddar cheese helped and the large serving of green beans was ok after I drowned them in butter. And I can drink whole milk. I'm not stuck with that watered down version. No ice cream though. But I did get to eat 6 piece of bacon with my breakfast this morn. Two fried eggs and an almond breakfast bar. I like bacon. I shall splurge at lunch and sprinkle a few raisins on my waldorf salad. Shall eat that with the half of the leftover steak that the hubby didn't finish last night. We have black walnuts up the ying yang this year and they're much better than the regular walnuts in the waldorf. I really don't think diet's the issue other than the lack of energy I'm feeling due to the lack of carbs. The problem is I eat the carbs, get the energy and the brain turns to mush. I can't seem to win. I don't need a nutritionist as much as I need some insulin. The gp was saying it should help me get some of my strength back. He said he's never started someone on insulin with an a1c below 6.5 but my god, if I keep on this diet, trying to control it, I'm going to waste away to nothing. This will be another instance of treat the patient and not the labs. It'll allow me to add the carbs back into my diet. I'm also looking forward to the extra pounds. I've got my catcher's mitt on.

Transferrin production is regulated by the arm of the thyroid hormone receptor and is upregulated by T3. High T3 = High transferrin. It's normal for me!!! It's also not anything to worry about. High transferrin levels by themselves don't hurt a thing But regardless, I still feel like crap. I just feel so ill all the time and the weakness and exhaustion is totally overwhelming. I'm so tired of it. The other thing I wanna gripe about is the lab reports. I've had two smears done where my blood has been examined under a microscope. Two different labs. Both have shown abnormalities. Anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. Fine, they're there but no one bothered to describe them. What type are they? There's many different types and you can't even begin to guess what might be going on without a description as to exactly what size and shape they are. Does it cost more to have the technician tell you exactly what they're seeing? I know they see something or they wouldn't say it's there. Is it a guessing game, or what? To me, that's unconscionable.

Interesting thing is I actually had a normal set of labs. Everything on the CBC and CMP was normal. Edema was gone and I felt good and everyone said I looked good. My thyroid labs have stayed consistent since I started the T3. No ups and downs and I really don't feel that it's the thyroid causing this.

And I'm babbling. I don't mean to. I just keep running all this stuff thru my head.

I spent 25 yrs seeking a diagnosis and my mom spent most of my childhood trying to find one. I've got a disorder called resistance to thyroid hormone. I walk around with elevated thyroid hormones and normal TSH levels because my pituitary seems to be a little hard of hearing (the resistance part) and doesn't always know when to stop pumping out. Sometimes things seem to shift and the pituitary starts to go hog wild. The higher my TSH goes, the higher my thyroid hormones go and the more hyper I get. We're using the Cytomel to keep the TSH level down. It seems to be working very nicely. I'm just a tad bit backerds. My gp just calls me \"weird\". I have felt worse since the cortisone but other than it raising the sugar a notch, the cbc's didn't change. I did get a major sinus infection last month and then a case of shingles which didn't help matters and now I've got a cold. Since I'm still angry at the dermie, I may go ahead and blame all that on him too. The cortisone could have messed with my IgG deficiency and opened me up to more infections. I really appreciate your thoughts. I do think the cortisone is probably part of the problem right now. I just know if we don't find the original what, I'm just going to keep on feeling like crap. Nobody seems in a hurry about this except for me. Sure, the labs aren't way out of line. Even I would have ignored them if it had only been once or twice, but a solid year and a half of it? Especially when I've been feeling ill? No way. They're telling us something. I just don't know what. A couple people have told me that I'd probably feel a lot better with insulin. I've been trying to control this with diet with only partial success. The gp was a little hesitant cause he normally starts off with meds but after we talked about the contraindications and side effects of the various meds, he agreed that none of them were right for me. He said I have to see the diabetes educator first. So that's where I'm headed next. Maybe that will fix it all??? It's cold and windy here too. The leaves are doing the same thing but I also remember them doing that last year. Last year we still had beautiful color. I'm expecting the same this year. We just haven't reached peak yet. It has been a mast year for black walnuts though. I've never seen so many. Hubby's been gathering them. Squirrels have been stealing them. They didn't touch the buckets of the unhusked ones but they did leave one bad one in it's shell in the bottom of the bucket of husked ones. I had to laugh. His expression was classic. "}, "25": {"a": "16321", "t": "He did tell my folks that I'm his favorite patient. But that doesn't seem worth a hill of beans when everything seems to take a month to 6 weeks either waiting on a specialist or waiting on tests results. By that time, another issue has arisen and the last issue gets superseded. I wish I could rent him for a day or two and just go over the whole dang thing at once. I know he likes to hunt and fish. I wonder if he likes to hunt squirrel. You forgot the shingles. This was my second case of them. The other one was 2 and a half years ago and it seems to be what caused the shift that shot off my thyroid again. I had had it semi-tamed up until that point with beta blockers. I think the Cytomel, along with the acyclovir that was started at the very first pinpoint sign of them kept it in it's cage this time. I did feel a blip and watched the thyroid enlarge for a time but it settled right down. It's really none of those and it isn't a resistance to TSH. The resistance is to the thyroid hormones themselves. It's a mutation in one of thyroid hormone receptors that are located in every organ of the body. RTH is characterized by elevated free thyroid hormone levels and partial resistance to thyroid hormone at the cellular level. What they have found causes it is a single amino acid substitution in the ligand binding domain of the beta form of the thyroid hormone receptor. Not everyone has the exact same substitution but whatever it happens to be, it mucks with the organs' ability to utilize thyroid hormone. The pituitary and hypothalamus are almost exclusively under the control of beta receptors. They are in essence, hypo. Other organs are either dominated by beta receptors (i.e., the liver), some by alpha receptors (i.e., the heart) but most have some sort of mix. Part of the body ends up resistant, other parts aren't. You end up partially hyper and hypo at the same time. Some people are more towards the hyper, some more towards the hypo but most people are pretty well balanced and remain mostly euthyroid. It's very much an individual thing depending on each person's particular chemistry and it can fluctuate over time as different internal or external forces change that chemistry. It makes for an interesting life. Now I'm wondering about those two cysts in my spleen. I wonder if they have anything to do with all this??? I wonder if they deserve a closer look? You know me.

I had GI misery for 20+ years, some bouts lasting 8-12 weeks, but repeated invasive tests (ugh!) ruled out inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis). Then came episodic urinary misery, including bouts of stones. Migraines. Hair loss & weight loss. Low-grade fever. Joint pain & pain along long bones of arms/legs. B-12 anemia. Neuro-like symptoms (tingling). Panic attacks (airplanes, driving, subway); those really discombobulated me because that wasn't my personality or temperament. Can you describe your \"problems with sun\"? I'm curious! Reason I ask is that I had years of a bizarre rash that 7 (or so) suburban dermatologists didn't recognize, even after doing multiple deep-punch biopsies. Recurrent red raised papules on my arms/back appeared then \"morphed\" into circles with clear centers, then expanded, then faded without scarring/depigmenting. Lyme was ruled out quickly. The lesions were finally diagnosed as the \"annular\" form of SCLE (subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus). (For the record, there's a second form of SCLE called psoriasiform, that looks like psoriasis but isn't.) For RASHES, the lesson I learned is that there are many more lupus rashes than the two best-known = discoid and malar! Another lesson I learned is that my local drs. didn't recognize all the antibodies possible in lupus, but I don't really know if ONLY anti-histone is a possibility (sorry!) . Do you have a copy of your labs? What do you see OTHER than anti-ds-DNA, anti-ss-DNA, anti-centromere, and anti-histone? Mine turned out to be anti-Ro, which my local drs. didn't look for.

Have you seen the sticky posts (permanent info posts) at the top of the thread list? They contain info on how lupus is diagnosed, common symptoms, tests, etc. One key thing to derive from the \"stickies\" is that ANA alone doesn't diagnose lupus. ANA elevates in many conditions: many within rheumatology; and in certain endocrine, lung, neurological, GI, blood, skin, (and ETC.) conditions. Also due to some viruses and infections. Also due to certain drugs. Also because of age or family tendency (but I suspect for those last two, ANA levels are probably low-ish). Re: nephritis, that your blood tests & urinalysis are normal strikes me as good news. I *think* with nephritis, urinalysis is apt to reveal protein in urine; and CBC blood tests are apt to reveal elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and/or elevated Creatine. So before you worry yourself \"sicker\", I hope you can get your doctors to further explain your lab results. Speaking of doctors... in your shoes, I'd probably try to see your general internist quickly, given you've had swelling for a whole month. (Next maybe rheumatologist or some other specialist, depending on internist's take.) You mentioned that certain foods seem to play a role. Which? Are you on any meds or OTC's? Have you taken anything as an adjunct to the acupuncture? (You should take all that info in with you.) As to whether you should limit fluids, I wonder if that could create more problems than it solves (dehydration, urinary stones, etc.)? You should ask your internist. You could also ask if you should limit salt while you wait for clearer answers.

I was diagnosed hypothyroid 2 years ago and with adrenal fatigue about a year and a half ago. Felt better as my thyroid stabilized and have had some good stretches along with some bad. Currently running on another bad stretch now, feeling poorly for a few months now. Adrenal fatigue was only treated with natural supplements (Adreset) and I've had some major life stressors lately and wonder if this has been too much for my adrenals. Currently waiting for results of my last saliva test. I just do not feel well and one of my biggest issues I believe is food digestion. Meals just seem to sit in my stomach. Also have battled acid reflux and was on acid reflux meds for the past 2 years but even that was not helping the heartburn. Was switched from Aciphex to Nexium, no help and was told to take 2 per day and then felt even worse. Decided to stop PPIs altogether and take digestive enzymes with my meals. Doc confirmed my problem could be low acid and not high acid and gave me a stronger enzyme to take with meals, but I have still been fighting the heartburn. Trying to limit carbs and sugar and add some probiotics but still just don't feel well. I also wonder if I am having issues with hypoglycemia or insulin resistance, but sometimes I feel worse after eating and I thought eating was supposed to relieve symptoms??? I'm wondering if these issues could all be adrenal fatigue related. Anyone start taking Cortef and notice that their digestion system seemed to work better? I wonder if I should push for a glucose tolerance test or if I should wait to see the results of the saliva test and if starting on Cortef to see if that helps. Of course I want to be better NOW.

Jen - did your doc start you on thyroid meds or something natural for that too? I was not diagnosed as Addison's but with Adrenal Fatigue. And my numbers were all 'in range' but at the bottom on the range, especially first thing in the morning. If they are worse now my doc will start me on Cortef. If they are not that bad I will be asking for Glucose Tolerance Test as I know SOMETHING is way off. I have not been dianosed as Hypoglycemic but I've explained the episodes I've had and my doc said you can have hypoglycemia episodes with thyroid and adrenal issues. I know a couple gals on the thyroid board have been diagnosed with Insulin Resistance and have started Metformin and feel much better. Since I suspect hypoglycemia I have been increasing my protein and limiting my carbs and sugars. And yesterday I actually quit taking the digestive enzyme as I felt like I had too much acid and I'm feeling a bit better. Thanks for mentioning the heart palps. I started getting this about a week ago as well AND for the past month or so I also battled a bit of jaw discomfort. Classic signs of heart issues but I've also learned this stuff goes along with acid reflux too! I've expressed heart concerns with two different docs and they did not seem concerned but I might make an appointment with a cardiologist just to give me some peace of mind even though I am sure it is acid relux related. I'm still holding out for that magic pill! I'm hoping for me it will be Cortef or Metformin. I think of my thyroid meds as a magic pill. The cure was not immediate but I sure felt like death before I started taking them. Do you know why your thyroid and adrenals crashed? I turned 40 this year and wonder how much perimoneopause comes into play. Also I was going through quite a bit of stress before my crash then went on a weeklong trip to Disney with my family which I think was too much for my overweight body.

B12 tends to run low in people with thyroid and adrenal issues. I was having issues with tingles in my fingers and toes so asked to have mine tested. At the time I also had issues trying to get my eyes to focus, but thought that was just another one of my hypo issues that I hoped would resolve in time. My GP said I was 'in range' at 536 (range 200-1100), but when I switched over to my Naturapath and brought my test results they said they recommend injections for anyone under 800.

She was diagnosed T2 at 70years of age. We wasn't told about a glucose monitor to check her levels. We just relied on her blood test results. Her blood test results showed very high levels of sugar so her Metformin was increased to 800/850mg x2 a day and then 3 times a day because her levels continued going higher and higher. One day her levels became so high she nearly slipped into a coma. I called the doctor and she was perscribed some more diabetic T2 medication to lower down her sugar levels. It worked for about 3 weeks and then she went up sky high again and nearly into a coma. This kept happening. All my doctor said was keep on with the medication. After she'd been on the medication (not the metformin the other one) she had a massive heart attack and nearly died. We found out her heart was damamged by the high blood sugars, her arthritis had gone from very mild to severe and her blood pressure was dangerously high. She was changed straight over to insulin 38units twice a day for 2 years. Then she had too many hypos where the blood sugar becomes very low and nearly slipped into a coma several times. Once again the doctor did nothing so I took it into my own hands and gradually lowered down her insulin till her levels were stable. She's now on 18units twice a day and her blood test result are the best theyve been in years. Because your husband has just started insulin, check his levels every 2 hours. If he has something he eats regularly, test him 2 hours after eating this and see if its affecting his sugar levels. My gran adores oranges and fruit which is good for a diabetic (sometimes) but they send her levels up. So whenever she trys something new to eat, I test her 2 hours after and see what her levels are. When she is ill with a cold or chest infection etc, I higher her insulin by 2 units to keep her levels stable. Unfortunately now her levels are creeping up again as you'll see from my post on here. My gran is overweight too but shes losing it gradually which is better for her than losing weight suddenly. Your husband needs to eat healthily (even food he doesnt like) and exercise. I do notice when my gran goes for a little walk to the shops her levels drop down quickly and she goes into a hypo. Exercise and my gran doesnt mix but I bring some sugar or a sugary sweet with me in preperation for a low episode. You wont see changes right away.

Also I am on Avanda(2mg 2X) along with Metformin. The two together work better than alone. You would think that your husband would be on more than that.

I lost 60 pounds in 9 months and have held to the top of my acceptable weight range. . Because your husband is having the most trouble with diet I suggest you google Richard Bernstein, MD for your education.

Knowing what his bg's are is key to figuring out what he is doing and what is hurting the most. I don't like it either, but it is important to understand where you are. You, the patient or family, have to take control of the treatment program. The medical profession is out of the loop here.

My DH needs to come in to get his done and do a semen analysis even though he has already, we are just trying to qualify for the Outcome Based Program. I'm glad we are starting around the same time.

Jill "}, "3": {"a": "7393", "t": "Hi Kari, To answer your question... the Outcome Based program allows three IVFs and kind of works as an insurance. Since my insurance will not cover anything I really would like to qualify for the Outcome Based Program. You pay a big chunk of money and when you do IVF if it does not take or end up in a live birth you can get 100% back not including med fees though that is if you have had enough of IVF. If you would like to continue they will do a fresh cycle again and if that does not work you could get 75% back or if your brave to do it a third time they will do another fresh cycle. If it doesn't work a third time you will get 50% back and they will not do a fresh cycle a fourth time. The cool part about this too is all your FETs are covered everytime. The gamble is it is double the amount of one IVF so if you get pg the first time it still is the same price...but I believe it is worth it. To know I can try three time helps.

I am trying to spend as much time with my mom but with work and getting ready it seems almost impossible.But I did quit a week before I am leaving so we will have the whole week just the 2 of us cause DH will work up until we leave.So my last week will be nice spend it shopping with mom getting our nails done etc. I just hope you will be able to do beta before I leave cause it will be so hard for me to get online when I get there.I will be just running to peoples houses trying to use their computers...... lol.Even if I dont I will be praying so hard I just hope you get that BFP and wont have to deal with IVF again. Kari how are you sweetie its been a long time I have missed being around.So you said you wont cycle until Sept.I wont know when I will cycle next until my appointment with RE in Augs.I am hoping I can cycle in September.But I just dont know if I will be ready by then who knows what the RE will have me do before I can cycle.Anyway we will soon find out right.Well I hope you are well and know I have missed you.

If and when the time comes for me to give up coffee then I am going to do that too. As for bugs, ugh, I hate them! We have these huge insects called wetas in NZ. They are gigantic and really scary looking and we had one here the other night. It was really scary even though they are harmless. Anyway, normally if we get an insect inside it is my DD who is only five who has to remove it if DH is not home! She is fearless, when we were in Australia she even had her photo taken with a snake around her neck! DS did too but unfortunately he seems to have inherited my phobia of bugs.

I am just like you, there was no way I was going near that snake. Everyone who wanted a photo taken with it had to line up and if the parents were in the line then they had to do it too.

Kari I don't really have my hands full as both my children are at school now. Infact, I think I have too much time on my hands now! The plan was to have baby number three when Sophie was still small (she was only 2 1/2 when we started trying) but unfortunately it just hasn't worked out that way. However, I am determined to have my third baby and I will not rest until we have exhausted all of our options. That is so great that your friend was in NZ - next time you have to come with her and come visit me, we have a spare room! I have never been to the South Island. It is common for kiwis like myself to travel all over the world but not within their own country. It is in our 10 year plan to hire a campervan and travel the whole country. I really hope that your next cycle does bring you a BFP. Nothing would make me happier than for every single one of you to be preggers by the end of the year.

Lovely, I feel silly saying that I wasn't aware you were starting Lupron soon. I must have known you were as you are the one who started this thread. I just get a bit forgetful and overwhelmed sometimes. Sorry. Also, I can completely relate to you making a scene at the airport (boy that must have been funny)! I was driving in the car once and had to pull over and jump out because there was a spider on the dashboard. There were some guys working on the side of the road and one of them hurried over to see what was wrong. I'm sure he thought I was a bit loopy when he saw how small the spider was. We don't even have poisnous spiders in NZ, I just don't like the way they are so creepy. Kelly, I always knew I wanted more than two children. My biggest regret now is not TTC sooner after our youngest was born. I often wonder what would have happened if we had tried to get PG when Sophie was still a baby instead of waiting until she was two. It seems like so much can change in a short time and I just really wish we'd done it while things were still working inside me. At least with all of the modern technology today we still have a lot of hope. It would be lovely if you had a little girl next time. I desperately wanted a girl and was just thrilled when she was born. Next time I don't care what I have, I will take anything.

If you have 10 follies all around the same (good!) size this early in the game, you are doing just fine. And I agree with Holly about what your doctor said about only having ten to work with going forward. On day 5 of stimming I had 25 measureable follies, on day 7 I had 37 measurable and then two days after that I had over 50! (I wrote down everything during my cycle, so these #'s and the timing is correct). Now of course you don't want anything near 30+ follies, but I guess my point is that they will grow and increase. And you'd be surprised at how fast it happens now that you've been stimming for so long! My RE also said it was important for all of them to be around the same size, so sounds like you are doing pretty good. Hang in there girlie! Kelly, I'm excited for your u/s on Friday too. I hope everything is going well right now. I know little Tyler is so young, but I was just curious if he has any idea that something is going on to try and get him a little bro/sis.

Saturday is going to be such an exciting day... I will probably not be able to respond to you until very late that evening, but I'll be thinking of you and your beta all day!!! Amelu, I'm glad you are feeling better. And you may be right that your Dr thinks that you will have 10 mature eggs after E/R... and that's a great number for mature eggs! It won't be long till we know for sure. Your E/R is in a about a week, right? Kelly, that is cute that Tyler asked if u were gonna buy him a little bro or sis! Kids really are so precious.

I believe I would start bcp right away and hopefully only for 21 days and then start lupron a day or two before last bcp. Guess we won't know much till my day 3 u/s. Holly, the reason we only recently found out about DH's poor morph is b/c we had been seeing (wasting time) w/ my obgyn for over a year (b/c of no insur). He did a SA on DH in 2/06 and simply looked under a scope and told us literally 2 minutes later all was good. My RE, who I started seeing in early April, confirmed that DH's count was excellent (like 40mil post wash before an IUI w/ him), but noted the poor morph after the full lab analysis. Frustrating cause we wouldn't have wasted so much on the medicated IUI and BD cycles had we known this 14 months earlier. Enough of that, how are you???

As for treatment, there really isn't any (although I hear change in diet might affect morph and motility). So my RE recommended we go straight to IVF, which is what we were trying to do when I over-stimmed. So we will try and try again!!! Mapia, I agree with Holly... you must be so busy right now wrapping up all loose ends, trying to spend time with your family, not to mention finishing up with your job and all!

Never tried Amaryl but your story reminds me, after taking Dyazide for high b.p. twice a day from about 1962 until two or three years ago, my b.p. suddenly started going \"too low\", probably from taking a lot of garlic pills instead of antibiotics for my allergy ear infections. I too went for adrenal testing, high end of normal, and visited the Addisons forum here quite a lot where nearly everyone complained about doctors just blow you off.

Then you'd take your other meds. I heard recently, the FDA is reducing potency again, second time since 2000, I believe, and probably you've all noticed, the Labs take a very long time to change their forms when \"normal\" TSH has been lowered. It's now .3 to something, right? But they still have 3 or maybe even 5 as normal range on forms. We all seem to have extreme tiredness, and I wonder if some of that isn't due to inadequate thyroid medication. Has anyone asked? If you're on a little higher does, for instance levothyroxine 300, and I heard of one person on 500, and still have symptoms, all but two of the two or three pages of hypo symptoms, usually you can't find a doctor who's prescribe more than even 200, much less increase elderly peoples' 300. We would be a little afraid of it too. They seem to fear it damages the heart, but one day I overheard a patient in the hallway being admitted to a hospital with a too-slow heart rate, 2 seconds or more between heart beats. Her husband was telling the doctor she was always cold when he was burning up. It seems to be typical of hypo's that they don't even think to tell their doctors these things. So what's the truth? It's almost impossible to find a doctor who'll not keep making you nervous about this one med. Mine just added Atenolol, which I've been protesting a long time, finally bought one month's supply, only $6, and cut a pill in half. I had some pain and burping, as if the heart was changing gears or something, can't think of a better description. I was frightened and drank a whole bottle of water to try to dilute it, know a drugstore with a machine where I can check my heart rate, and I don't plan to take it often if at all. I went in yesterday to complain of tiredness so bad I sometimes have to take aspirin for it, have had a lot of laser recently for retinopathy, have six weeks to recover before any more of it, also had a foot ulcer infection. I think my doctor's entirely too impulsive, insisted on putting me on this w/out apparently knowing it causes even more tiredness. A pharmacist verified he should have done some tests. He's still having trouble with the language here, and I'm looking for someone for second opinions or to be my regular doctor, who'll be smart enough to understand Dr. Lowe, that best TSH level isn't always the same for all patients. I need mine low, .1 or lower. But the gov't keeps reducing the potency. By the time we resort to something like thyrolar probably it'll become hard to get that too? Worst case scenario. Anyone good at educating doctors about thyroid? Some say they only studied it a few minutes. Also a few other subjects. They never seem to look up side effects of prescriptions. I always double check online and maybe with knowledgeable pharmacists. I'm a senior, slightly asthsmatic, very diabetic, take Lisinopril for b.p., pletal for circulation, metformin er and Glipizide, plus otc decongestants which the allergist told me can cause rapid heart beat.

So more waiting I guess. I hope that you have a good response to the gonal f.

I responded ok to the clomid, had two good looking follicles the last cycle at the time of IUI.

I will have another u/s and blood test tomorrow which will be cycle day 12. I have been on the gonal F since day three. I guess the norm is to be on it for 7-12 days or something like that. I think I will be on it closer to twelve days cause I don't seem to be having a quick response to it. As of day 10 my E2 was still low and my follicles were still small. All docs offices are different as far as monitoring goes. For example while I was on clomid, I was monitored from day ten through the time of trigger shot about every other day with blood tests for E2 and ultrasounds for follicle and uterine lining growth. My friend who is going through the same thing in a different state only gets an ultrasound on day twelve and no blood testing. I think my office monitors even more closely when it comes to injectibles because there's a higher chance of overstimulating and stuff. I think they would cancel my IUI if I had too many mature follicles or if my E2 levels showed that I might be overstimulating. I would check with your docs office to see what the standard protocol is for monitoring while on gonal f.

I had my u/s and blood test yesterday and got to talk to my doc which was really great. All of a sudden my ovaries are awake and I had four maturing follicles and one that may or may not start maturing. They like to see two to five follicles for an injectible/IUI cycle so I am right on track. I am continuing on the gonal F and had another blood test today. I think I will have to go back for yet another u/s and blood test tomorrow. My doc was very encouraging. He said that my body responded the way they wanted it to for my two clomid cycles and is doing well with this gonal f cycle too. He said we'd try this three time then move to ivf. I think the reason for starting with IUI's is because my husband's sperm count and motility were slightly on the low side. I also think that they do it for unexplained infertility. We're in the unexplained/mild male factor category. At first my doc thought our only problem was the fibroid I had removed in January so we tried from Feb til june with no success on our own in addition to two years of trying with that stupid fibroid in the way! I think a lot of clinics just start out with the drugs first and then move to IUI so maybe you won't need the IUI! Hopefully you'll get pregnant right away with the gonal F. So, if you don't mind my asking and feel free not to answer if you don't want to, why do you need provera to bring on a period? I read things about that and that they often prescribe gonal f or other fsh only drugs for women with PCOS so I didn't know if that's what you had or not. I read that women with PCOS often have a great response to gonal f on the lowest dose. Maybe that's all you'll need! Let me know how it goes!

Once you do ovulate, it probably won't be long before you get pregnant. I had another u/s and blood test today. Five follicles, but I think at teh time of IUI only three will be fully mature. That's good though I guess. I think the trigger will either be sat or sunday and the IUI monday or tues. I am trying to have a positive attitude but... Ya know, I don't want to get my hopes up. So next week I'll be started the dreaded 2ww. Let me know how things go for you when you start your shots! Jody, Oh my god, that's too weird how similar our stories are.

I have another one but it's not blocking anything (facing outward not inward) so the doc's not concerned. Mine was removed with hysteroscopy too. I hope that your hysteroscopy shows no new fibroids in there. Hopefully the one your doc saw during the csection was in a nonobstructive place. I will be thinking of you!

I am in the 2ww now. Had the IUI on monday. Had 5 follicles but I think only two or three were mature enough at the time of IUI. Hubby's sperm looked good though. They want the final count for IUI to be at least 10 million and his was 75 million (double what it usually is) so we were like WOO HOO and high fiving each other when the nurse was going over the stats of teh sample. She must have thought we were crazy! So, here we wait. Started progesterone yesterday too. I am not getting my hopes up but trying to stay positive. Keepin busy. Know any good apple crisp recipes? I have a huge bag of apples we picked last week and they're going to rot if I don't do something with them. You can only eat so many apples and it will give me something fun to do. I will check on line. Anyways, thanks for writing and I hope to hear from you soon saying AF came and you got to start your shots and stuff! Good luck!

One day late is good, some tests can even detect hcg four or more days before AF is expected. But it's always better to wait until your a day late because you could get a false negative by testing too early. I unfortunately, used to be a pregnancy test junkie. I'd buy the three packs and start testing a few days before I expected AF and keep going until AF came. Crazy I know! And those tests aren't cheap. Since I have been cycling I haven't taken any HPT's. What will I do with all that money I am saving! Have you been testing for ovulation by charting or ov. predictor kits? I used to be an ovulation predictor kit junkie too. Finally I broke down and bought the clear plan monitor, figured it would save me some money!

Yeah, the E2 is estradiol and I guess it is a measure of how mature your follicle are and they can also tell if hyperstimulation is likely by the level of E2. But I think it's just an extra measure, they can probably tell that through ultrasound too! Don't worry. If you're concerned you can always ask the doc why. Well, we got a BFN unfortunately. Since I was on progesterone suppositories, I didn't get AF yet. Stopped the progesterone so now it will be on it's way any day now. I feel the cramps and bloating already. I am ok, handling it better than I have in the past. No tears this time. I am hoping now that we know what level of gonal f to start with hopefully this next cycle will be even better. I see the last one as an experiment since he started me on only 75 then moved me to 112.5 and that's where I stayed. This time I will start on 112.5 so we'll see. Thanks for the update!

Sorry I couldn't be much help with that! I have to go in for my base line ultrasound on Sunday. AF finally showed up today. That progesterone delayed it.

I've *finally* found me a doctor that is going to look into actual problems instead of prescribing a new birth control pill. My symptoms are very irregular periods, even on birth control. As of this coming Monday, I'll have had my current period for 3 weeks, which has never happened before. I started a week before my pills said I was scheduled for, and now I'm about to go on week three. I've had periods that lasted for two weeks, but never three. Usually it starts out with brown blood, not bright red until the 3rd day or so, when it gets very heavy. The pain is so extreme, which runs down my right thigh. I have a pulling, pinching pain in my lower left pelvic area, which usually comes before and during my period, but does also happen any time. I have diarrhea 90% of the time, and I have to urinate a lot. OTC meds only take the edge off the pain, and I've been prescribed Darvocet for when I can't function. I started my period on my 11th birthday (now 24) and they've been horrible as far back as I can remember. My mom mentioned to me the other day, that when I was around 10, my weight ballooned, which was just before I started my first period. I was a thin child prior to this, not overweight at all. I've had my thyroid checked (my mom had this done after my accessive weight gain in my early teens), but that was normal. I've been on 5 different bcp's since the age of 16, none of which help for more than 3 months. This is the first doctor who's ever taken my concerns seriously, and who's mentioned a hormone test, doing different exams and procedures to find out what's wrong. I've had an internal vaginal sonogram before, but this was done at the hospital, not by a gyn., and my gynecologist said that if I do have PCOS, the first sonogram wouldn't probably have picked up on it b/c the technician wasn't looking for that, just looking for my ovaries (which she had a hard time finding.)

My fasting glucose test result was 121. my doctor did say that to be considered diabetic, usually the result needs to be 125 and above, however, due to my weight, family history, and the 121, he feels confident that i am diabetic. he doesn't believe i'm pre-diabetic. Im going back in tomorrow to do a drink test and then from there, he will determine what dosage of medication to give me and that we will work on a diet plan. he already said, i'll be put on Metformin, just not sure yet of the dosage. My question is, can i be diabetic if my blood pressure and cholestrol are normal? my co-worker has diabetes, but also has high cholestrol and blood pressure and she said they all go hand in hand. so im just confused how i can be considered diabetic if my other test results came back great?

I think i'm just feeling overwhelmed with emotions. i know that millions of people have diabetes and live a great life, i know logically, i will be OK and this is a lifestyle change and that even though the diabetes part won't be great, this will give me the motivation i need to go back to losing weight and eating better, because I want to live another 50 years.

So, he has diagnosised me as being Type 2 diabetic. I am now prescribed Metformin 500mg, 2x a day, however for the first week due to the reaction people have, he said to take it 1x a day and then in 2 weeks, increase it to 2x a day. i did find it interesting, one of my co-workers was recently told she was diabetic and she is also on Metformin 500mg, but only 1/2 tab a day, so I just find it interesting i'm taking it 2x a day. I also got prescribed a monitor, so now I get to test my blood sugar. i hate needles, so this should really be interesting for me. the nurse used one of the monitors in the office today and it did hurt, but not as bad as i was thinking it would, but still, it will be weird for me to actually make myself bleed, but I know it's something I need to do. I went to the bookstore this weekend and got 2 books on cooking for diabetics, because i do love to cook, so these will be good for me. also got a book about diabetes as a whole and about the various aspects of it and it kept repeating, family history. I think im at peace with this. i sorta knew it was coming and i knew today would be 50/50...either i was pre-diabetic or i was diabetic. i also know my doctor is doing this because of my family history and weight and i guess i would rather him treat me for something now with the hope that i can better my life than to not treat me and 2 years from now, i'm worse off. i just keep telling myself, medicine has changed so much since my parents died. i was 19 when my mom died, 28 when my dad died, now im 34, so i know that medicine has changed, that even diabetes treatment has changed and i just keep telling myself, i'm me, i'm not my parents. i refuse to let me get to the point of being so sick it will kill me because it's too late, i want to be here to see my husband and my dog forever. i also need to do aerobic exercise 45 minutes a day, 5x a week on a scale of 4-5. would any of you have a suggestion for that? does walking count as aerobic? right now, between walking during breaks at work and walking my dog at night, i do about 45 minutes a day, but i don't know if aerobic is considered walking. i also need to change how i eat, make fresh fruits and vegetables my focal point. he said that my fruits and vegetables at all meals should take about 1/2 my plate, so that will be something i need to get used to, but im sure the cookbooks will help me with creative and good recipes. so, i feel like i want to cry, because i had hoped i wouldn't be like my parents and become diabetic, but i also know, im in control, my parents didn't control these, i will and i will be OK. like i said, im at peace with this. i'm diabetic and life goes on. as long as i have my mindset that this will not conquer me, but I will conquer it, i'll be ok. I know i'll be coming here more and more often for advice or just to express how im feeling, because i know you all understand. thank you all so very much for just being so supportive this last week or 2, helping me understand things and helping me figure out, this isn't the end of the world. it's a lifestyle change, but change is good. again, thank you all.

When he told me he felt my fatigue, gloomy outlook, daytime napping and inability to lose weight was from my blood sugar and not thyroid I thought he was crazy.... but he was right. He dug deeper. He is also a Phychiatrist. sp? The high insulin is a prerequisite to Diabetes... but you need a 2 hour done to show the entire picture. My fasting insulin was normal, my 2 hour was sky high. I was placed on metformin and I could not believe how much better I felt and my weight fell off. My blood sugars are perfectly normal. My Endo explained you can have a perfectly normal blood sugar but have symptoms for 5 years before you blood sugar problems show up. Your Insulin tests will show it early if you have a problem. I am 56 now. This started for me when I was 48. Sudden weight gain, fatigue and so on. I then started on my journey of spending tons of money on saliva tests, compounded hormones, supplements, different diets, books, health programs, Chinese herbs, accupuncture, and several Doctors...... . none worked. Only on my checkbook. Finally at 53 nodules appeared on my thryoid and everyone started taking notice. My labs were still normal but they started treating me due to my goiter and nodules.... See I was not imagining this...... . Well now I know I have Hashimoto's, Celiac, a milk allergy that was totally unknown to me and Insulin resistance. I am just now starting into Menopause late but doing fine with it. My Endo tells me I was developing what they call Metabolic Syndrome. Wieght gain, mild high blood pressure, lipid elevated, and weight around my middle. So now my thyroid symptoms are better, my weight is down ( not back to my original size 7 but close enough), blood pressure is normal, cholesterol and triglycerides are normal, I am energetic and have no more brain fog. I have changed my diet completely and do not eat dairy or gluten. I exercise everyday even if it is just walking or lifting hand weights. I enjoy a glass of red wine every night encouraged by my Endo. I hope this all continues for me. I feel so happy. FYI the Testosterone compound made me irritable and I gained weight on it. This does not mean it will happen to you but keep an eye on it. I was on Zoloft for a short time. I only took 50 Mg instead of the 100mg. It actually worked well for me. It is the best one for people with anxiety. That would be me. My Dad had passed away and my kids had left home. I would take it again if needed. I would hesitate to take a new or different one. Good luck, sorry this is so long but maybe it will help someone.

Perhaps the cause is different and maybe the solution should be different, too. That makes sense, I guess. So I'm wondering - have any of you had genetic typing done regarding your diabetes? Anyone a type 1.5 or other specific diabetic type? What types of diets have worked best for you? I've been thin all my life, but was close to what I consider my ideal weight a year ago before I was diagnosed with diabetes. Since then, I've lost another 14 pounds, not deliberately, just by trying to keep my blood sugars down without having to increase my meds. Now I'd like to try to gain some of that weight back. My doctor wants me to increase carbs, but she won't increase my meds out of fear of hypoglycemia. I averaged 2000 calories a day last week without gaining a pound. I'll admit, however, that I did it mostly by increasing fat and protein rather than increasing carbs, as I just don't like the feeling of high blood sugars. I'm hoping that some of you will be able to share experiences that directly or indirectly might throw some light on what's going on with this body of mine. ___________________________ Diagnosed diabetic T2 Oct 2011 6 mg glimepiride, 2000 mg metformin, 20 mg statin daily First A1c Oct 2011: 11.5 Last A1c Oct 2012: 7.0 108 pounds, 5\"5\" "}, "1": {"a": "4730", "t": "Azurah, are you able to control your BG through diet alone, or are you on any meds? And what type of diet are you on - ADA, low carb, vegan or what? I see so many differences in what doctors recommend that I'm totally confused. I'm on close to the maximum of meds advised without going to insulin injections. Because I've had many hypoglycemic episodes on the amount of glimepiride I'm on when I accidentally don't eat quite enough in a given meal or delay a meal too long, my doctor doesn't want to increase the med to the maximum. So I continue to eat less than I really should to get my weight back to normal. When I even approach the number of carbs my doctor wants me to eat, my BG ends up in the 300s, which gives me a very uncomfortable level of anxiety, almost to the point of tremors. In fact, when I tried for a few days to eat the 1800 calorie ADA diet the doctor gave me, my BG ended up in the 400s and 500s! That was before the last bump up in the glimepiride, though, but even though I'm now able to eat 2000 calories a day, I can only do that by eating way more fat and protein than my doctor wants. ______________________ Diagnosed diabetic T2 Oct 2011 6 mg glimepiride, 2000 mg metformin, 20 mg statin daily First A1c Oct 2011: 11.5 Last A1c Oct 2012: 7.0 108 pounds, 5\"5\" "}, "2": {"a": "4730", "t": "I came upon some interesting research yesterday. I am not liking this! Apparently the 15% of people who are diagnosed as diabetic when thin or of normal weight have almost double the negative outcomes (including early death) as those who are overweight or obese when diagnosed. They refer to this group as TOFI - thin outside, fat inside. While appearing slender, this group carries a lot of fat around their vital organs, strapped around their hearts and hidden in their muscles. Due to their heredity, they tend to be the \"apple shapes\" among us, carrying more fat than normal on their stomachs rather than on the rest of their upper or lower bodies. That last one sure describes me. As a skinny eighth grader, I had an 11-inch difference between my waist and my hips. Now back at the same weight at age 71, the difference is only 5 inches. It is expected that with aging, more weight will shift to the waist even on an underweight person, but the shift shouldn't be that much! From what I read, dietary changes alone will be inadequate with this group. To make a real difference in outcome, what is needed is exercise and lots of it. Half an hour a day will likely be inadequate. It probably needs to be one hour a day. Woe is me. That is exactly what got me to this point after all these years - I hate exercise unless it is in the process of accomplishing something. _________________________ Diagnosed diabetic T2 Oct 2011 6 mg glimepiride, 2000 mg metformin, 20 mg statin daily First A1c Oct 2011: 11.5 Last A1c Oct 2012: 7.0 108 pounds, 5\"5\" "}}}, "210535": {"truth": ["gain weight", "cloudiness mental", "pain muscle", "heartbeat pounding", "sleepiness", "fast pulse", "difficult breath", "nose runny", "muscle ache", "warm", "loss weight", "face swell", "wheezing", "pain lower back", "cough", "chest pain", "pain body", "increase sweating", "discomfort abdominal", "seizure", "urine pain", "upset stomach", "congestion ear", "pain back", "indigestion", "loss appetite", "anxiety", "difficult urine", "labored breath", "sore throat", "nervousness", "convulsion", "cold sweat", "confusion", "sweating", "drowsiness", "pulse pounding", "face red", "discomfort chest", "lower pain side", "tight chest", "shaking", "stomach discomfort", "swell joint", "intestine gas excessive", "difficult concentrating", "behavior change", "bad taste", "bruising", "pale skin", "pain joint", "diarrhea", "vision blurred", "stomach pain", "dizziness", "short breath", "tiredness", "pale", "nausea", "nightmare", "bloated stomach", "stomach acid", "weak", "speech slurred", "sneezing", "neck red", "dilated neck vein", "irregular heartbeat", "increase hunger", "taste change", "pain eye", "headache", "irregular pulse", "excessive stomach gas", "vomit", "pain cheekbone", "fever", "swell foot", "discomfort", "fatigue", "heartburn", "sour stomach", "belching", "moving difficult", "gas passing", "voice loss", "arm red", "breath shallow", "nose stuffy", "strength loss", "chill", "hoarseness", "heartbeat fast", "bleed", "depression", "ache body"], "neat": ["stomach pain", "infection"], "umls": ["infection", "bleed urine", "dizziness", "urine pain", "pain leg", "pain back", "bleed"], "neural": ["infection", "dizziness", "bleed urine", "bleed", "urine pain"], "doc_content": {"0": {"a": "17668", "t": "my god you could have wrote my story , hi im a mother of 3 children , im at my wits end im also on iron liquid i have anaemia and an iron problem , i have had infections like you i wee alot and get really dehydrated do you and ,my wee is relaly really clear or a very one off brown im relaly scared my kidney functions have coem back ok but it will be hard to squeeze a scan out of the tight dr s i go to love katxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx "}, "1": {"a": "60946", "t": "hummm i looked up kidney disease and am now nervous.

I have been suffering the past few years with cronic pain, after two spinal surgeries and several minor procedures, epidurals, nerve root burning, etc. I am only 43 and I have attempted to go back to work twice and failed. I don't look hurt and it has been very hard to come to terms with not being able to do what I use to. I have stopped fostercare, I have stopped working as a CPSSIII Case Manager, I have stopped life basically. No outings, vacations with the kids, etc. I wont bore you anymore. But what I am asking is what I should expect from this eval. Like I said if you looked at me I do not look disabled, I am only 43, and I am able to walk with out a cane. I am on pain meds that make me loopy and if I don't take them I can hardly move. SO, has anyone gone to one of these physicals? What do they do? Can someone help me with what is expected? I have numbess in legs and arms; migraines; etc but too look at me you can't see that. I do have MRI's and EMG's that show herniated disc and pinced nerves that would cause my symptoms but again I don't look sick. Thank you for your help.

I have tried several times to go back to work and it was a tough decission to get where I am now but I am here and have to fight at this point. I have received my response for Long Term Disability and was told it will be dated back to October 2, 2010 so that was a nice bit of news today and takes the financial stress off getting the SSDI approval right away. So, I guess I can concentrate on healing now and not all this mumbojumbo garbage. I do have another question for you though. I work for the State of AZ so willl be getting ASRSA and have to pay COBRA insurance prices. I have been paying a little over $250 every two weeks but I am sure this will go up.

It states there is electrophysilogical evidence of radiculapthy on C6/7 and L5/S1 I am not sure what this means but I do know that it is getting worse not better. My employer has decided that since I had two failed work attempts that my 180 days starts all over again and I am still a full-time employee, which means I have to continue to provide notes from work dated and such. This is a hassle and I feel as if I am begging for a note for work like a child begs to stay home from school. I still don't understand how to get it across that I can not work.

SSDI has rescheduled my Exam to the first week in March, can say I am still very nervous about that. I have to say after about three days of rest I feel as if nothing is wrong with me and it is all in my head. I get up and start doing house work, grocery shopping and with in a few hours i am flat on my back with a few days to recoop. I can't imagine life continueing like this.

Not what I am a custom to.

Can't say I miss those. I have never taken pills in my life hardly even a vitamin, I have always suffered through headaches and minor aches but now I take Norco, SOMA, Metformin, some other spasm medication and another just for Migraines which are crippling. I don't know if I am dependant, addicted, or just really need them. The doctors are quick to hand them out. I don't want to end up messing up my life because of those pills. They don't take the pain away just dull it a bit and I am still walking around in pain and a \"Brain Fog\" as well. So, I am tossed. Any advise, suggestions I am welcome to them.

"}, "7": {"a": "3827", "t": "My employer is a global financial company with over 100,000 employees. In my role I worrked with STD/LTD, Life Ins, and Medical Stop Loss Excess Risk . Stop Loss/Excess Risk are plans where large employers are self funded and medical claims are paid from employer dollars, nor ins co monies. Thus they re-insure to protect losses in excess of usually $750,000 to $1M and that's what we'd provide. One choice each employer has is how to handle Medicare eligibility. Since I am on LTD and nearing 2 yr out of work my employer sent me a large information packet on what occurs when /if I get approved for SSDI and Medicare begins. Included was the entire medical plan document to show me all provisions and specifically Medicare . When eligible for Medicare it is mandatory that under my employer's plan Medicare becomes primary and I can shift to a Medicare supplement plan under my current insurance company. Because my employer will continue to provide benefits into retirement if I remain on LTD until 67 (my SS full retirement age) I do not want to exit my plan and enroll in my husband's medical plan even though less expensive. Our hope is for him to retire early in 5-10 yr and he'd need to enroll in health ins under my employer as he'd only be around 55. My employer is self funded for health insurance and thus they want to transfer the financial risk to Medicare and thus reduce their financial obligations. At any time, as long as I remain on LTD I can add my husband to my employer's health insurance at full spouse rates until he becomes eligible for Medicare. Every employer that is self-funded, as many lare employers are, have the option to choose how Medicare eligibility is handled. As medical costs have soared more employers continue to shift to Medicare as primary. It's a continual shift in the industry (I read industry publications to keep up on trends) and more and more Medicare is required to be primary as a choice by the employer to save large employers money and decrease the health insurance loss ratio and thus keep premiums down for employees and dependents enrolled in the plan. Small employers who are \"fully insured\" andd for whom the ins co pays claims out of ins co monies then the employer has no choice as to how Medicare is handled and thus Medicare as primary is the industry norm to again shift financial obligations to Medicare.

It's not \"time to go\" but time to realize you are growing older and your body needs some assistance in staying healthy. Let me ask you if you take aspirin? Do you know that if it wasn't around before the FDA was created, it would probably be a prescription drug due to all it's side effects. Don't get freaked out by side effects. By law they have to list all of them...and that means they have to list anything that someone thought might be happening to them while in a clinical trial...even if there was no proof of what the person reported. So if someone was in the clinical trial and felt metformin was turning them into a werewolf, the company is obligated by law to report it and keep reporting it....for the life of the drug....even no one else ever becomes a werewolf. But there are other drugs...ask your doc. Many other drugs. Or you could go on very small amounts of insulin...they can give it now by nasal spray.

I don't think I have had PCOS my whole life,and I think something has caused me to suddenly develop it in the last few years.I actually have a 14 year old daughter,so getting pregnant wasn't an issue for me in the past. I can tell you,that since I have been having these ovary issues,my cholesterol has been through the roof.It went from like 220 to 283 in a year's time! My doctor wants me to start taking lipator. For me it was a rapid weight gain in about a year's time.About 30 pounds and I barely eat at all. I'm also hypothyroid though,so that probably contributed to some of it. Yes, alot of women with PCOS suffer from acne...You should consider yourself very lucky to never have had it! I had it quite severely at one point, and after years of going to the dermatologist,I knew something was wrong with me that was causing it.And I was right,it was my hormones.As soon as I started on Spironolactone, my acne cleared right up. (Spironolactone is prescribed for PCOS and blocks testosterone.It also helps with the hair growth issues too) It is also prescribed to women with PCOS to help with the bloating that we get. I have heard Metformin has gastrointestinal side effects.Is that why you didn't like it? How long were you on it? I'm glad the insulin works for you though.I doubt they will put me on that though.My glucose levels are actually pretty good. Fsh is Follicle-stimulating hormone,and LH is Luteinizing hormone.I believe women with PCOS usually have a high ratio of LH to Fsh.It is easy to get tested,just a simple blood test. You are so lucky you also don't have mood swings.I have read many women with PCOS also have depression issues,and I definitely have those. Even more so since I have not had a period in 3 months.But I also heard once they are treated (usually with Metformin,which also stabilizes hormones) that they tend to feel better.So maybe since you are on insulin treatment your moods aren't affected? Trust me,I don't want anymore kids either-but menopause is no joke. At least if it is anything like how I have been feeling...Crying one minute,angry the next,hot flashes,weight gain,night sweats. It really is like PMS 24/7. Which is why I so desperately want to get my hormones straightened out.I wasn't always like this and I really miss how I used to feel.

Yes i am taking this very seriously as i don't want to end up like my poor mum who was diabetic (on insulin) for 12 years before she died at the age of 74 due to heart failure, she was 74 years of age and she became diabetic through getting pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) not sure why or how she got that because she did not drink alcohol and pancreatitis is mainly associated with heavy drinkers. My mother was a very well controlled diabetic (sometimes too well controlled i used to think) and not really sure how she got heart failure but i they say that diabetes can contribute to that, i am really scared about the complications but i'll try not to dwell on it too much and try and get on with life as best i can (with my diabetes always in the background). I just hope and pray that whatever i am doing will help towards preventing any complications relating to diabetes. I know that the internet can be scary and if you read up things you can scare yourself stupid but i have also heard and read of positive stories of diabetics who, with looking after themselves can live a long healthy life. I have a strong family history of diabetes, my mother had it, both my grandfathers from both my parents side had it, unfortunately my grandfather on my dad's side died at the age of 73, he got gangrene but was not a well controlled diabetic and was faced with the choice of amputation or death and he chose not to have amputation which obviously led to his death. On the other hand my grandad on my mother's side was diabetic also and he lived to the ripe old age of 86. Two of my aunts are both Type 1 and they are in their 70's and still OK. I don't know why some diabetics are affected more than others when it comes to complications, i guess it's all down to everyone being different. I want to keep regular check ups on my feet so am wondering whether to have, say pedicures quite regularly and also want to have heart risk assessments screenings maybe once a year or more (they can be quite expensive). What do others out there do to get tested for complication prevention? "}, "2": {"a": "42328", "t": "I keep hearing about this A1c test which is really important. Is this done just once a year by the Nurse? How hard is it to keep the number under 7? i have heard that you can also buy home testing kits for this, would anyone recommend it? Also Coravh, did you say that you have been diabetic since 1966? how have you coped? how has the journey been for you personally? "}, "3": {"a": "42328", "t": "I saw the diabetic nurse on Monday and basically she said that i will get my A1C test in 3 months time which will be January, although i have found a site where you can buy the tests online and i will prob do that while i wait until January to have my proper one. She won't give me any strips or lancets on prescription, only urine sticks which means that i will have to pay for them myself and they are not cheap so will have to try and make 50 strips last me a month as i can't really afford to buy them twice a month at \u00a325 a time. She has given me details to attend a one day group called DESMOND which will advise and teach you on food types and carbs etc so i have my name down on the list and just have to wait until i'm called to go so that should be very useful. All i can do at this stage is carry on with my weight loss and keep walking every day and watch my food intake and get tested. She also told me that i was very lucky as at my particular practice they have a very good diabetic care team and i will be checked every 6 months whereas she said some practices only do it once a year so that is good news. The only off putting thing i have come across is that i tend to read up stuff on the net about diabetes and some are really scary in what they say about diabetics ie they say that a diabetic is more likely to die from heart disease than a non-diabetic and that in the US it is the 7th listed cause on death certificates with death occurring from complications relating to diabetes. On some sites it really does emphasise how serious it is but then on the other hand you hear positive stories of people who have manged to control their diabetes for years and still be able to avoid complications. Does anyone know (or have read anywhere) what the general statistics are for the longevity of a diabetic? "}, "4": {"a": "42328", "t": "JJ, thanks so much for your encouraging words it really does help 'speaking' out on here if one has concerns. I seem to be focusing on the bad side of diabetes, i know that it has to be taken seriously and i guess it is important to drum this into diabetics so that i suppose you don't get too complacent and think you don't have to work so hard but i have realised in the last few weeks that this is going to be hard work for the rest of my life but i need to do it so that i don't run into trouble. Because my poor mum died of heart failure due to it being a complication related to diabetes i still think to this day that she may have 'saved' herself if she had spoken up sooner but she was looking after my poor dad who was disabled (after suffering a severe stroke) 24/7 that i think the stress of it all led to her neglecting her own health. I was close to my parents and saw them every day and i remember my mum complaining of shortness of breath and the fact that she thought her legs looked a little swollen and i remember a few days before she was taken to hospital i tried so hard to get her to see a doctor but she insisted she was OK, well i know now that she wasn't OK, she obviously had heart failure but i think that she was so worried about who was going to look after my dad that she just didn't say anything and denied to herself that anything was wrong. She may have been able to get treatment and live a bit longer but that is something i will never know. One of my aunt's is in her 80's and is diabetic but she also has Alzeimers and this is more of a problem to her that the diabetes. Yes i do strongly agree that it is going to be a case of looking after myself, probably more than i would have done before being diagnosed but in a way, like someone else said on here, it has probably saved his life being diagnosed because i would have carried on thinking 'oh i must lose weight' which i have been saying for the last 20 years and carried on over-eating and not doing much excercise so it has given me a 'kick up the backside' now to take my health more seriously (and i have given up smoking too). I hope that my hard work pays off in the next 3 months and hopefully i will not need medication but hopefully be able to control it by diet and excercise. I will let you know how i get on.

Well I went stepwise through treatment and diagnosis. 1) First found and treated was the Hashimoto's/hypothyroidism as a result of my symptoms and extremely high antibodies. This started me on T4 supplementation (Brand names: Levoxyl, Synthroid, Levothyroxine, and Tirosint... there are more and there are probably brands specific ones in your country as well). I was started on 50 mcg of Synthroid. This helped with some symptoms but not all. Pushing the thyroid medication was warranted by my Ft4 level, but over conversion of T4 to T3 drove me hyperthyroid by T3 toxicosis. Symptoms fixed: Thyroid eye disease, migraines, some fatigue, constipation 2) This pointed that I had another issue to address. . hypoadrenalism. So we did the tests: Saliva 24 hour cortisol, ACTH, ACTH stimulation test, DHEA, Cortisol fasting 8 am blood serum, estrogen, testosterone, vit D, B12, ferritin. My ferritin B12, K, and D were all low. This and the cortisol levels being in the out house pointed to hypoadrenalism. I then had testing for the antibodies that kill off the adrenals (ACA) and found out my adrenals just died from too long hypoT. But my TSH was normal! *snort* So I was put on 20 mg of hydrocortisone daily in addition to 75 mcgs of Synthroid. Things were beginning to feel better, but things were still not right. I researched the ACTH stim sex hormone results and cross matched my symptoms and the HIGH DHEA levels and went back to my MD with my MD SIL's list of tests need to confirm/refute PCOS and IR. . Symptoms addressed: electrolyte imbalance, heart issues, fatigue, hypersomnia 3) So I was tested for PCOS/IR/hypoglycemia. This was proven by my blood results and uterine ultrasound. I had all three. . WHEEE! I love the pre-existing conditions line on medical information forms. The receptionist look at you funny when you ask for another sheet because you ran out of room... Treatment Metformin XR. I stepwise progressed to 1500 mg. Symptoms addressed: weight gain in the middle, PMS/PMDD symptoms, irregular periods, mood swings, and many other pesky female things. A large portion of remaining fatigue went away as well as energy was increased upon treatment. Now my thyroid hormone levels while suboptimal and low for me are balanced. My blood sugar/insulin issues are balancing out with the Metformin XR. My hypoadrenalism is in check. So symptoms left are the skin issues which I keep in check with my Dermie's help and special creams, weight is stagnant, joint and muscle issues, cold feeling, and periodic fatigue. I am working on getting rid of them all, but it does take time. Now it is a matter of getting my thyroid hormones optimal and seeing where things go from there.

On the issue of continuous vs intermittent ADT, there was published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, the results of a Canadian comparative study among 1,386 men who had failed primary radiotherapy and were assigned to either continuous or intermittent ADT. It showed that intermittent was not inferior to continuous on overall survival, and that there were some quality of life benefits to IADT. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22931259 Together with a dear friend of mine, who is also on IADT, having failed RP, failed RT, pGleason 9, N0 and M0, I've been investigating whether it might be of benefit to try now certain available cancer therapies that are normally only tried later with mCRPC. Our hypothesis is that attacking the cancer on a number of fronts; i.e., a cocktail, while it is still hormone responsive may actually provide a chance at curing it. He noted that cocktails are used for HIV and many cancers, so why should we wait until our cancers become castrate-resistant before bringing out the big guns? (Most clinical trials only allow men with metastatic castrate-resistant PC.) At the same time, he didn?t want something he took now to preclude taking it or something else later. Using docetaxel, abiraterone, or Provenge now, which probably all have a good shot at being more effective if used earlier in the game, may preclude the use of the next generation of chemo, hormone therapies and vaccine/immune stimulants when they become available for clinical trials. He was looking for something more powerful than nutritional supplements and dietary interventions, which he is doing anyway. We ignored for now the question of whether insurance would pay for it. So we came up with the following requirements: 1. Has a good chance of working with your hormone therapy 2. Available by Rx now, outside of clinical trials 3. Won't interfere with getting on clinical trials or other meds later Based on those requirements, I came up with several classes of medications that might improve the effectiveness, long-lastingness, and, stands a chance at putting the cancer into remission: angiogenesis inhibitors, somatostatin analogues, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), mTOR Inhibitors, Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibitors, Metformin, Statins, and COX-2 Inhibitors. I mention only a couple of nutritional supplements that pertain to those categories. There are some other substances (e.g., HSP blockers. IGF inhibitors, prolactin inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, Custirsen) that might be useful in a cocktail and are in clinical trials, but I don?t know of any that are already approved. We showed our investigations, together with all the peer-reviewed references, to his oncologist, Dr. Scholz, who is amenable to trying the cocktail approach. However, we decided to hold that off for now while we try some advanced imaging approaches first in order to determine if his disease is in an oligometastatic stage that may be slowed by SBRT to a few lymph nodes. If you or others are interested, I will post an extensive explanation of the \"good witches brew\" that we came up with. - Allen "}, "1": {"a": "2160", "t": "It's rather lengthy -- about 10 pages including all the references. Maybe I'll exclude the government references for now, but if in discussions with your oncologist, he would like to see them, let me know. Many of these are quite powerful. They all have drug interactions, contraindications and side effects that should be carefully analyzed. I'm not a doctor and don't recommend any of these -- I'm hoping that it may be a good kickoff to a conversation with your oncologist as it was to my friend's. Thalidomide is the oldest, and a newer version, called lenalidomide (Revlimid) may possibly be more effective or have fewer sides. I know Jim has been taking thalidomide. These drugs will make you very sleepy though, which can be a good thing if hot flashes keep you awake. They may also have immune suppressive effects. The hot new one in this category, Tasquinomod, is in clinical trials and will probably get fast-tracked for FDA approval. A previous one, Avastin, did not prolong survival for PC and was disapproved by the FDA for breast cancer. Lanreotide and Octreotide are synthetic versions of somatostatin, the hormone responsible for antagonizing somatotropin (growth hormone). As prostate cancer progresses, the somatostatin receptor is less expressed, allowing the cancer to grow more quickly. It would seem to make a lot of sense to use this sooner rather than later. It is always given with a corticosteroid. A new version called Pasireotide has been approved in Europe. It?s only a single case study, so I throw it in just as a curiosity, but it seemed to completely cure the advanced hormone-responsive PC of one man: \"Complete response to the combination therapy with androgen blockade and somatostatin analogue in a patient with advanced prostate cancer\" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17316966 As an interesting side note, a recent study of over a million people showed an association between height and PC that could not be explained away by other risk factors. Maybe tall guys like me have a surplus of growth hormone: \"Adult height and the risk of cause-specific death and vascular morbidity in 1 million people\" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22825588 The role of estrogen and estrogen receptors in prostate cancer is very complex. Estrogen is an old therapy and is sometimes still used as a second-line therapy because it acts in the brain to inhibit the production of androgens, called negative feedback. However, estrogen receptor beta (ER?) is highly expressed in prostate cells, and when activated, it seems to have anti-proliferative properties. ER? may have an opposite effect, so the trick is to activate ER? without activating ER?, hence the elective odulators (SERMs). The estrogen story is even more complex: a person may have damaged estrogen receptors that are unresponsive to ER? stimulation, or the receptors may disappear -- estrogen receptors diminish as the cancer progresses (the opposite of the androgen receptor). Therefore, it makes sense to use this earlier rather than later in the progression. Gamma and delta-tocotrienols are thought to enhance ER? activity. It is available as a pure annatto extract from health food stores and on the internet. It?s important not to try to obtain it from other mixed Vitamin E extracts ? even small amounts of alpha-tocopherol seem to suppress absorption of tocotrienols. Clomiphene is a relatively cheap and effective SERM that may be worth trying. It selectively blocks ER?. Also, soy isoflavones stimulate ER?, so taking the two together may be a good one-two punch. I should add about clomiphene that it would not make sense to take it while on Lupron, and could be dangerous with it. Clomiphene blocks the ER? receptor, which in turn controls the negative feedback between steroids and GnRH in the brain. Therefore taking Clomiphene with a GnRH agonist (like Lupron) may cause a runaway super-flare of testosterone production. It should work fine, however, with a GnRH antagonist like Firmagon, or with Casodex plus a 5-ARI. Here?s something that?s as confusing as it is interesting about all this. There is a drug in clinical trials now called Capesaris that could potentially be used instead of Lupron. It does the opposite of what clomiphene does in the brain -- it is ER? receptor . In the brain, the ER? receptor mediates the negative feedback between steroids and GnRH. That?s why estrogen was given as an old treatment for PC ? it shuts down the pituitary signal that stimulates androgen production. Capesaris similarly enhances the negative feedback to GnRH, thus shutting down androgen production. The hope is that it will be less harsh than Lupron or Firmagon. It remains to be seen if its anti-proliferative effect of shutting down androgen stimulation from the brain exceeds its pro-proliferative effect on the ER? receptors in the tumor. If I were a betting man, I'd wager that it slows down the tumor at first, but will stimulate growth of the tumor eventually. There are about a dozen different tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical trials now for PC, and dozens more for other cancers. They represent the hottest area of cancer research right now. They work by inhibiting certain growth factors within the cancer cell. They are usually used in conjunction with other cancer therapies like hormones and chemo, and they can be combined. The hottest one for PC is called Cabozantinib (formerly XL 184) and seems to clear bone mets almost miraculously in 12 weeks. Exelisis tried to get early FDA approval for it based on relief of bone pain, but the FDA insisted on a demonstrated survival advantage and asked for a lower dose to improve tolerability. It?s in Phase 3 trials now. Several TKIs have already been approved for other cancers, but none yet for PC. Those could potentially be prescribed ?off-label.? However, it is possible that using one now may preclude getting one in a clinical trial later. If it were me, I would wait for Cabozantinib approval, which may not take too long if it keeps performing as it has been. The TKIs that are already approved for other cancers and are in clinical trials now for PC include: Axitinib (Inlyta), Dasatinib (Sprycel), Erlotinib (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa), Imatinib (Gleevec), Sorafenib (Nexavar), Sunitinib (Sutent). PC uses Interleukin-6 (IL6), an immune cytokine, to protect itself, and IL6 seems to interfere with TKIs. Immunosuppressors like mTOR inhibitors (see below) may suppress IL6 and may work synergistically in a cocktail with TKIs. Corticosteroids, which are usually included in these cocktails, may help also.There is a monoclonal antibody in clinical trials, Siltuximab, designed to suppress IL6. In addition to stimulating the ER? and inhibiting angiogenesis, soy isoflavones may also act as TKIs. These target a cancer proliferation protein. Three have already been approved for use in cocktails against other cancers, and are in clinical trials for use against prostate cancer. They could potentially be prescribed now off-label. The approved ones are Sirolimus/rapamycin(Rapamune), Temsirolimus (Toresel), and Everolimus (Afinitor). However, Everolimus failed to show any incremental benefit when used with Casodex in a recent clinical trial. Would it work in conjunction with a TKI and/or an GDACI (see below)? The jury is out on that. Note: These are all powerful immunosuppressants used to prevent transplant rejection, and may also cause diabetes-like symptoms. Not something to stay on for a long time. Valproic Acid (Depakote) is a well-known anti-epileptic and mood stabilizer that was recently discovered to have powerful anti-cancer effects. It may cause PC cells to differentiate; i.e., lower Gleason grade. It and other HDACIs are in clinical trial against prostate cancer. In lab studies, it had a synergistic effect with Everolimus (see mTOR inhibitors, above). The anti-diabetic drug Metformin seems to have a powerful anti-PC effect. It may only work in conjunction with statins. It?s clinical trials now with statins and with Lupron. Metformin enhances the antiproliferative and apoptotic effect of bicalutamide in prostate cancer. Statins may slow down the growth of advanced, high grade androgen-independent PC cells. However, this association has been found only in some epidemiological and retrospective studies, and not all of them. Some researchers believe that health-conscious men are both more likely to take statins and to get PSA tested earlier, which would explain why they show up with less advanced disease. Some lab studies support its role. A large controlled prospective study is underway, using red yeast rice as a statin surrogate; the results may provide a more definitive answer. Meanwhile, there seems to be few downsides and many potential upsides to taking low doses as part of the cocktail. Although early results in animal models and in small scale trials looked promising, the first large scale, controlled study (the STAMPEDE trial) of celecoxib+hormone therapy vs hormone therapy alone showed no benefit to celecoxib (Celebrex). Whether or not it may have a synergistic effect with other ingredients in a cocktail remains to be seen. Aspirin (which is a mild COX-1 and -2 inhibitor) and other anti-coagulants like Warfarin were associated with reduced mortality in men who'd been treated with RP or RT in a retrospective analysis published this week. It seems like a reasonable supplement unless their are known sensitivities or contraindications. I've written in previous posts about how I believe that prostate cancer will only be cured if we look at it as a system of interacting cell types, almost like an ecological niche. If we attack only one cell type, as by androgen deprivation alone, for example, we are sure to cause some other deleterious cell type to take over. I was, therefore, intrigued by an interesting lab study from the University of Rochester (one of my Alma Maters ). They suggest a two-pronged approach. For the typical androgen-sensitive cancer cell, they suggest an attack with a turmeric/curcumin derivative called ASC-J9. It seems to degrade the androgen receptor without allowing it to find away around the therapy. Interestingly, ASC-J9 is being investigated as an anti-baldness and anti-acne medicine. For the prostate cancer stem cells, they want to accomplish the opposite: repair and stimulate the non-functional androgen receptor. When the androgen receptor on a stem cell is activated, it encourages the cell to differentiate; i.e., become less cancerous. They propose doing this with two substances. One, called 5-AZA, is in a class of of chemotherapeutic medicines called demethylating agents. It fixes old (methylated) DNA. However, although available (sold as Vidaza in the US), it can have some serious side effects. The other agent they tried against the cancer stem cells is gamma tocotrienol, which activates the ER? receptor (see SERMs above). In their lab studies they found that this combo suppressed castrate-resistant cancers. "}, "2": {"a": "2160", "t": "Baptista, I quite agree that we must view the cancer as an evolving ecological niche of cell types, each impacting one another. We know that cells send molecular \"signals\" to one another; a nearby healthy cell may induce a cancer cell to differentiate, whereas as nearby cancer cell may induce a healthy cell to de-differentiate, becoming more stem-cell like (i.e., more cancerous). As you point out, targeting only the androgen-dependent cell population induces adaptive changes in some of those cells. It also kills off some of the androgen-dependent cells (healthy and cancerous alike) which allows for the growth of androgen-independent cells to take over the ecological niche, just as spraying Roundup to get rid of one weed may allow a Roundup-resistant weed to take over. I was fascinated by the following paper published this week about cancer stem cells. The authors argue that \"stemness\" (i.e., lack of differentiation) is a dynamic process. They hypothesize that all prostate cancer cells possess stem cell properties and that the \"stemness\" is modulated by the microenvironment. A key prediction of their model is that to cure prostate cancer, prostate cancer cells (both those already exhibiting stem-cell like properties and those that haven't yet) should be eliminated at once. Otherwise, the ones that haven't yet will be induced to. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3423925/ This is similar to something I put forward in a recent post where I discussed efforts to mathematically model the cancer as a system of dynamically changing and interacting cell types: http://www.healthboards.com/boards/cancer-prostate/885192-blood-work-before-iadt-vacation.html I would add to that the following model by Gatenby and Vincent that argues for a multi-modal approach: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14555711 We all discussed Hussain's presentation at this year's ASCO meeting about how continuous ADT was superior to intermittent ADT in men who had metastatic yet still hormone-sensitive PC. Yet we saw this week that in a Canadian study of men with a recurrence after RT, IADT was inferior to cADT: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22931259 Perhaps the difference is that the \"stemness\" of the metastatic disease was already well-established in Hussain's study group and it was too far gone to be slowed by the re-introduction of androgens during the vacations; whereas the Canadian group had more of the non-stem-like cell type that was better maintained during the vacation periods when testosterone was allowed to rise. If my hypothesis is true, the timing of various therapies will be important in determining their curative power. It may be impossible to restore the ecological balance of cell types once they have progressed (or been pushed by our well-meaning interventions) beyond a certain tipping point. - Allen "}, "3": {"a": "2160", "t": "I wanted to update on my friend.

He had his blood sugars tested in 1991 and they were 360 and his doctor at the time just told him to \"just lose some weight.\" Three years later he got very very sick and the same doctor told him he had the flu. He was drinking 4-5 4L jugs of water a day, was practically bed ridden and was in very rough shape. When he pushed and said it wasn't the flu he got his blood sugars tested and they were 540. Essentially, he had gone at least three years of undiagnosed diabetes and who knows how many years before that. Thankfully that doctor retired and he got a new doctor who gives dad a lecture if his sugars stay over 110! I agree that you should find a doctor who knows a bit more about diabetes because shrugging off a sugar level of 132 is not cool. Given my father's history, he was immediately put on diabeta (glyburide: I don't even know if this is prescribed anymore) because his pancreas was pretty worn out from such high levels for so long. He was put on insulin in 2000 along with metformin and has been doing well. I also agree that you should be tested to see which type of diabetes you have. If you are not overweight you could have either, although type one onset is more common for those under 30. However, if you are type one you would need to go on insulin immediately.

When I got back on track I felt awful at normal sugar levels because I went back to normal so quickly. I had headaches, I was irritable, and I felt generally sluggish and weak. However, I pushed through it and now I feel back to normal and I no longer feel hypo when my sugars are in the 4.0 range like I did before. Hang in there. You won't feel 100% right away but it won't be long until you do! "}, "8": {"a": "54752", "t": "Yup, you definitely need a rapid acting insulin if your sugars are spiking that much after a meal such as the one you had. The great thing about a rapid acting insulin is that you DO have more freedom in what you eat, and if you want to splurge every once and a while you just adjust your units. Just be sure to ask about \"carb counting\" when/if they put you on the rapid acting insulin. That will tell you how much you have to take (it's usually around 1 unit to every 5 carbs, but I know it can vary with T2 based on your level of insulin resistance, and I also find sometimes I need an extra unit or two for certain foods -- but you'll figure that out with time). Another thing I wanted to mention in regards to your weight is, you may find you'll put on some weight or have a bit of trouble in the beginning to lose some weight because when your sugars were so high your body was essentially starving its cells of nutrients. I had a period of about 5-6 months when I just said \"screw it\" and had horrible control. I lost 15 pounds in that period and I was eating some pretty awful food, so I should've gained if anything. Anyway, when I woke the **** up and realized how ridiculous I was being I actually gained weight and had a hard time losing any weight and my diet has been impeccable. My body's kicked back into gear now and I've lost about 30 pounds in the last four months. So please don't get discouraged if your weight goes up a bit on the insulin! Keep doing what you're doing.

When I was getting my sugars back under control my morning levels were always a bit higher compared to the rest of my day, but once they were normal for a while I started consistently getting readings in the 4 range (which is the low end of normal where I'm from ) I can't say enough about how much better it is to bring your sugars down gradually. I brought mine back down very quickly (a lot of insulin at the onset) and it was a bad idea. I felt hypoglycemic at 5.0! I also had headaches and felt generally blah, but my doctor told me that my body was so used to having high sugars that the sudden jolt back down to \"normal\" made my body think my sugars were too low.

I'd strongly recommend going to see the latter once a year if you only saw an optometrist. Also, did your eye doctor put drops in your eyes and look at the nerves in the back of your eyes or was it a straight up eye test? I'm assuming it was the drop test if he/she knows your diabetic As for your first appointment with your endocrinologist, it's been a few years since I've seen one (and another year at least before I get to see another *eyeroll*), but most likely they'll weigh you, get your history, talk to you about your lab work and probably discuss blood pressure/kidney/cholesterol issues you might have (conditions relating/caused by your diabetes). This would be an excellent time to bring up testing to see what type you are. They'll most likely send you for more blood work afterwards and set up a follow up appointment as well. My last appointment I was put on lipitor and altace, but was off of them within a year because my kidney function returned to normal (and my BP went down) and I didn't like the idea of being on lipitor knowing what it can do to a fetus (if any accidents happened I didn't want to have to deal with that possibility).

I find even a low carb meal does have an effect on my sugars (we're only talking going from the 4 range to the 5 range, so it's still normal, but it's still a rise) and while I don't take any rapid unless I'm eating carbs, there is still a little jump. Well done on the 92! I think if you put the rapid into your insulin regime you could keep those numbers under 110 for sure.

Do you think the supplementing estrogen may have tipped things towards more /final destruction? When I had a sestamibi the report indicated virtually no functioning thyroid tissue--isn't that lovely. So , maybe your idea of rising anti TG in the final phase of the thyroid in hashi's has some validity as I seem to be in the final phase. What's your story now-GOT THYROID?

Long story. She has been in ER four times since the beginning of September. first time: complained of stomach feeling 'raw,' light-headed, black stool, no appetite, very weak. Her oncologist told her she was dehydrated and should go to hospital. I called her primary who said 'if she goes in, it will be for a 24 hour iv fluid.' Took her in. Day they were supposed to release her her hemocratit was 24. Did a scope to her intestines (a colonoscopy done a few weeks back was normal). they found a dieulafoy's lesion and a blood clot in her small intestine. They injected the lesion with medication because it was infected. Cauterized it. Removed the blood clot. second time: still not feeling well. while in ER this time and then admitted, they had nitro patches on for very high blood pressure. Ranged from 275/102, 245/98. Put in a cathedar so she wouldn't have to get up. basically started her on anxiety pills and discharged her. they did do another scope to make sure she wasn't bleeding. also had echo of heart, ct scan which came back fine. third time: She broke her wrist! just getting out of bed. By this time her anxiety and feeling like she was going to jump out of her skin was real bad. She got worse each day every time she was in the hospital. They put her from ER to EOU (emergency observation unit). Had a psychiatrist see her who adjusted her meds. told us to see a neurologist for her dizzyiness. They found that she had a UTI - from the cathedar at last visit. Started on iv antibiotics every 12 hours and oral. When they wanted to discharge her, we said there is something wrong. They kept saying 'see a psychiatrist' because my mother was so agitated and crying a lot. She would say 'I just want to go to sleep and wake up and be better.' She asked us, as your mom asked you 'when will I be better?' Thankfully my sis from out of state was able to extend her stay to help. at home: after my sis brought mom home, she gave her the nightly insulin. About an hour later, my mom convulsed. thrashed her arms and legs uncontrollably and whole body shaking violently. Very cold sweat, extreme distress and crying. Sis checked her blood sugar - it was 20! Mind you, mom has a history of getting low bs which she corrected by eating. But she never felt it. This time she did. Sis called aunt who is a visiting diabetic nurse who told her to give her orange juice immediately. They gave her milk and a peanut butter sandwich. sugar went to 220. From this reaction we concluded that each time mom was in hospital they gave her multiple insulin shots. we are trying to find out exactly how much. We are also going to ask why EOU does not recognize the signs of insulin overdose. which are anxiety, tremors, crying, jumpy feeling. Next day they called primary who said to cut insulin in half. I should tell you what she was on. Levemir 20 units at night. That night an hour and a half after giving mom insulin, she convulsed again! Fixed it again with food. Went to see the primary who non-chalantly said 'take her off completely.' this was a Friday and we were able to see a diabetic doctor the next Monday. He switched mom to novilin (?) . She had to test before each meal. and an epy pen if she got too low. sis had to give her insulin at lunch and dinner. Just a little while after giving it to her, she convulsed and threw up. sis got epy pen and put it in her thigh and called 911. fourth time: in ER they monitored her and she was actually doing ok. ER doctor admitted her because her heart rate dropped to 35. They were supposed to get all mom's doctors together to figure out what happened. sis thought she gave mom too much insulin since she reacted as she did before when having too much although worse. Turns out at 2am her bs was 319. They determined it was a bad reaction to the new insulin - humulog. I could go on but the point is, maybe your mother is getting too much insulin. If she is crying like that and anxious, it could be. If she has decreased kidney function, the insulin is not filtered out as quick. Mom is home now and going back to the diabetes doc. Don't know what they'll try next but this is very scary stuff. good luck with your mom. ask how much insulin she was given and if they think it might be insulin shock.

She has to test before each meal so the figure pricking increased. No fun there. She is finally looking better. I believe that too much insulin over a longer period of time takes a toll on you and it seemed to take a month off of the long-acting levemir to get better. Besides the crying and ?when is it going to get better?I pray every night that when I wake up I?ll feel better and I don?t.? So sad and hard to hear. You and your family are in my prayers. I looked this up for you. CT scans are commonly done for cellulitis. computed tomography scan (Also called a CT or CAT scan.) - a diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to produce cross-sectional images (often called slices), both horizontally and vertically, of the body. A CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general x-rays. The extent of the infection is detected by performing a CT scan.

And it's impossible to tell, without some specialized tests, exactly how much insulin a person with T2 is still producing and worse...it's truly impossible to tell exactly HOW MUCH insulin they need in order to utilize glucose. But Type 2 very easily can be, and often is, managed by using insulin instead of oral medications, especially after several years, by which time they're probably not producing enough insulin so the metformin doesn't help as much. As for why her numbers are so high now, that's very hard to tell given the limited amount of information we have. Stress on the body from illness can absolutely make blood sugar levels go up. Kidney disease also affects blood sugar levels. If she's on prednisone, that would affect it, too. Liz, I don't know exactly what you mean by \"today her level was 320 from 90\"...does that mean that her lowest bg of the day was 90 and her highest was 320? If so, then they are not managing her correctly with whatever type of insulin they're giving her. That's another bit of information that would help...exactly what type of insulin are they using?

I am 20 years old. This is going to be a long post, as I have had many things that have led to this point. First, two years ago, I had my period for 6 months straight. It was really really bad. After 4 months, I finally decided to go to the doctor. Well, he said I had PCOS. After that I was diagnosed with diabetes, asthma, and irregular heart beat. Then, last September, I was having severe stomach problems, throwing up all of the time, constantly nauseated. They ran every test imaginable, until March, where they found out it was my gallbladder. I had my gallbladder out in April, about 2 months ago. A month later, I had kidney stones. I had to have surgery to remove them. Now I am having horrible pain again. It is like the kidney stones, so that is what I thought it was. Instead, the urologist told me today that the CT scan I had done yesterday showed that I had several kidney stones that were really small in both kidneys. I also have several small cysts on both ovaries. He told me that the pelvic pain is explainable, but the kidney stones were not causing pain, so I have been referred to a pain specialist for chronic abdominal pain. He said that it could be adhesions from the gallbladder surgery. But would that cause pain on both sides? It was done laprascopically. I am so confused, and in lots of pain. I have been through Vicodin, Vicoprofen, Darvocet, and Percocet (2 strengths), and now I am on morphine. I don't know what to do. Wondering why I am in so much pain. Don't know what to do.

I don't even know how to begin to look for one of those. I am already on the birth control ring, have been since January. I have had cysts for 2 years, but no medicine has gotten rid of them yet. I actually have to skip a month or two of the bc because I cannot afford it right now, and my doctor doesn't have samples. He doesn't know much about bc anyways, and my GYN is 2 hours away. I can't go another bc because my GYN said that I have to much risk for a stroke or getting worse migraines, and the ring has the least estrogen. I am really hoping that the pain specialist will give me some advice on what to do, other than just put me on pain killers forever. I have been thinking that maybe the stones are causing pain. It doesn't make sense that it is the same pain as when I had the last round of kidney stones and not be kidney stones. I am so confused. Thanks for your advice! I really appreciate it!!

I can't pay anything at this point, so getting really confused as to what to do, because I know that most doctors will make me pay up front. The area where I live is very limited in the doctors that are here. I have to drive an hour to go to the urologist at this point, and he is teh closest one. Spending so much money, and so far have no answers as to what is wrong. What should I do? Most programs that let you go for free won't do anything for people with insurance.

Sometimes I am able to go in and he writes off the copay for that day, however his office staff gets angry every time I go in. I hate being in so much debt for something that I cannot help!

Thankfully, I really don't need to go back to that doctor's office until I go back to school. Hs office is the one I visit while I am there. I have made a couple of trips up there this summer, but now I have a different doctor here.

I am trying to take things just one day at a time. That's what I need to be doing. When I go beyond that, I drive myself nuts. I will find a planned parenthood spot around here.

The urologist is going to be scheduling surgery to get rid of the stones, but he doubts that it will help with the pain. I am so scared, because I have no idea what it is that is causing the pain, and at this point, I am just hurting so bad. It is depressing me. That is for sure.

To answer your questions re: gestational diabetes is insulin resistant diabetes that develops during pregnancy but usually goes away once you've given birth. Women who develop gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of developing Type II later on in life. My obstetricians were quite confident, as was the endocrinologist, that given my age and weight, that the diabetes would have \"gone away\". However, my mother has Type II diabetes, and there is a strong history of diabetes on her side of the family. Given this history, the endocrinologist had noted that there was a strong chance I'd develop Type II later on in life and that I'd need to be screened every year. Neither of us thought it was going to happen this early.

I agree you need to learn to carb count. Not carb counting is like expecting a gallon of gas to get you 40 miles one day and expecting it to get you 100 miles the next. It's not going to work. There are so many variables in what you do and eat everyday. I know in another post you mentioned a desire to go with a pump. Carb counting was one of the first things I had to learn prior to starting my pump. A nutritionist can probably help you with it. Most of carb counting can be done off food labels, the rest can be done with a database, like calorieking.com. Serving size is an important thing. I would stick with your usual humalog doses for awhile, and just log everything, then seeing how many grams of carb he is eating when the dose works should give you an indicator of what his carb ratio is. I suspect this is where the CDE got 1:4 from. An a1c of 11.1 pretty much always suggests not enough insulin. I agree with the NP who said you need to increase the Lantus dose. But I wouldn't go into that with a set dose in mind. I would start with the 38 and add 2 units every 3 days he doesn't wake up below 100 fasting. But that's just my THOUGHTS you need to go with what your diabetes team wants to do. T1 patients often have a 50:50 ratio of basal and bolus needs, so for every unit of Lantus he takes, most people would require another 1 unit of humalog at some point in the day. This has a ton of variables, like how high carb the diet is, though. Most days mine is pretty much right on, but I will obviously need more bolus insulin if I eat high carb. If someone requires a lot more basal insulin than bolus, it suggests insulin resistance. Based on your husband's high insulin requirements, I suspect insulin resistance is already coming in to play. Symlin may be something to look into adding in the future, but I think I would figure out what his specific insulin needs are before adding a variable like that. Symlin is a drug that is injected with meals to prevent post prandial spikes. Some type 1s find their injected insulin works better if they add a type 2 oral med, metformin and avandia being the ones that come to mind. This is something that may benefit your husband right now.

Had I really looked at the ingredients before buying it i would not of bought it. first ingredient is SOY, bleh, not suppose to have soy with thyroid or so i was told by several people on a thyroid board. So too it has 20 carbs and only 4 sugar alcohol. They are suppose to control hunger by controling blood sugar levels for up to 9 hours. ! I thought this would be a good in between meal snack but so far it did not fill me up and I am still hungry and have not consumed 20 worthless carbs. I eat dreamfields, cooked el dente, and do not raise blood sugar. I ate some with some sausage and peas about 3 and by 5 was feeling hungry again. I took my Bs and I was at 94!!! No wonder I felt so hungry. I didnt want to eat only two hours after that meal so I've forced myself to wait another hour to eat. I figure I have to get use to feeling low blood sugar levels as normal instead of freaking out when i feel them and feel hypoglycemic and run for food... So now that I at that bar, I feel i've wasted some carbs. Do you know a good carb number per meal to shoot for. ? I' know i'm overloading on all these questions and maybe smeone else will jump in (doubtfull) and help so i'm not dumping all this stuff on you. Maybe i should go back to the dietician.

I ate again 1 1/2 hours later a low carb turkey wrap and never felt really good from then on today. My BS the rest of the day has been only up to 110 as the highest...and that was AFTER a McDonalds hamburger and a few fries.

So I dont know what happened today. that was before taking the Metformin which I only took 1/4 again today but will take 1/2 tomorrow for sure! any thoughts on this crazy thing today? I'm so thankful that my BS came down so quickly from that 178, that really scared me! I wont be eating THAT again...Well I hope you get some rest and dont worry about answering me till you are ready and feeling better. I feel so bad about your loss.

Additionally, there are genetic factors that may affect the progression, as well as all of the factors Mindy mentioned. such as diet, exercise, how overweight or not the person is and remains, etc. She also gave you good advice regarding feeling shaky at 108. Most people don't actually feel shaky until they're down in the 70's, if then, but if your blood sugar is elevated and then comes down fast, you might feel it in the 100's. Also, if you're used to being on the higher side, you would feel it in the 100's. As she pointed out, the trick is to get your body used to lower blood sugar levels. Even if you feel somewhat shaky at 107, your brain is getting plenty of glucose, so you don't need to treat it. It shouldn't take more than a few days to a week or so to get used to having your levels that low. By the way, I'm of the school that depriving oneself of ALL treats just sets you up for failure and a possible binge. And occasional chocolate treat shouldn't hurt too badly as long as it's a) VERY occasional and b) not a large amount at one time.

Tracking the blood pressure multiple times per day is a wonderful tool for guiding dietary changes, evaluating High Blood Pressure triggers, evaluating Heart Rhythm triggers, and for diagnosing metabolic problems. When I first started taking my blood pressure multiple times per day, back in 1998, I had no idea just how much can be learned from one's daily blood pressure patterns and trends. Insulin Resistance is a serious health problem which happens when too many carbs are eaten on a regular basis. The body produces extra Insulin in order to convert the carbs to energy. The body's cells can't handle the excess Insulin, so the cells try to defend themselves by rejecting Insulin, causing all kinds of health problems. I first started a clumsy attempt at dieting back around June 2004. In December 2004, after figuring out that I was Insulin Resistant, I went on a diet targeting Insulin Resistance; and I posted about it on HealthBoards, under the title: (Direct Link: .

During the years, 1998 through 2003, when my blood pressure was at very constant, unhealthy levels, hour after hour, day after day, month after month, year after year; my daily blood pressure pattern was a lot different than my daily blood pressure pattern was I learned how to have healthy blood pressure levels all the time. The most significant difference in blood pressure patterns was during evening hours. During the long years when my blood pressure was at unhealthy levels, my evening blood pressure went much higher than during the day. Since 2005, after I started a small meal, low calorie, frequent eating diet, my blood pressure went lower during the evening hours. What does this all mean? Well.... to me, it meant that my body's handling of Insulin had been dysfunction due to a poor diet, and I was either Insulin Resistant, or had some form of Diabetic condition. I've attached two charts, one of 1998, when my blood pressure was rising during the evening (non-dipping), and one of 2009, when my blood pressure was going lower during the evening (dipping). To see the full size charts, instead of the small thumbnails, just select or click on one of the thumbnail attachments. Following is the 1998 \" \" Chart showing Systolic and Diastolic averages by time, hour 1 (1 am) through hour 24 (Midnight) And following is the 2009 \" \" Chart Using these two charts, one can clearly see the non-dipping nature of the first chart (1998), which is often the case when someone is either Insulin Resistant or Diabetic; and also can clearly see the dipping nature of the second chart (2009), which is often the case when someone's Insulin Resistance and Diabetes is under control. Non-dipping means that my blood pressure rises at night, instead of lowering or dipping. Even though my current blood pressure is lowering at night, or dipping, and is obviously at very healthy levels, I still have to limit my carbs and do significant exercise in order to maintain my much improved Insulin Resistance and Diabetes. I can consume significantly more carbs than in prior years, but still have to limit them. I have also found out that, because of my Heart Failure, I also have to severely limit the other calorie groups: Proteins, Fats and Alcohol. Each time that I have increased the amount in my diet of any of the calorie groups, I have suffered from different health problems. Interesting charts, huh??? "}, "10": {"a": "51", "t": "Sounds like you have evaluated your own health needs, and are being pro-active, as always, in your own care. I have played that game of increasing, decreasing, eliminating blood pressure medications over and over again. In my case, I have Heart Failure, Persistent Atrial Fibrillation, Immune System Dysfunction, Insulin Resistance and latent Chronically High Blood Pressure, so it is an enormous challenge for me to keep my health, not only under control, but constantly improving. I am interested in how well you do by cutting back blood pressure medications. Some times it takes weeks, after elimination of a medication, to fully experience the effects of withdrawal. Plus... some blood pressure medications are very beneficial towards better health. I wish you much luck in getting your meds into a proper balance. What does that tell us? For one thing, it tells us that our doctors, with the limited amount of time that they can spend fully evaluating a particular patient's requirements, often make judgement errors in prescribing medications. Your research and analysis is paying off big time for you! You have never given up, and keep researching, researching, researching and evaluating until you come up with a better solution. It is wonderful that you are feeling much better. And..... you owe your success to your own efforts! Good for you!!! I love hearing that type of news from you!!! I've been fighting against Insulin Resistance/Pre-Diabetes since 2004. I've constantly tried to find the answer to the question: Can Insulin Resistance/Pre Diabetes be completely cured? I can only answer that question for myself, and the answer is NO! I can keep it under control, but I ALWAYS have to limit the carbs, and eat the proper carbs. So...... here I go as a full time \"dipper\", as long as I behave myself. I am glad that you find the charts interesting. My dietary restrictions are monstrously difficult. I not only have to limit the carbs, but due to my Heart Failure, I must also limit the fats and proteins, or I will suffer from differing health problems, and I cannot have any alcohol at all. It is maddeningly difficult and frustrating! It has led me to believe that most doctors do not pay enough attention to their patient's dietary requirements versus their diets. What we eat and drink directly effects our health and interacts with our medications. Our environments and lifestyles also effects our health and interacts with our medications. We do not all live in a bubble! We are all effected, ALL EFFECTED by our diet, environment and lifestyle. Yet this extremely important aspect of our health care is usually ignored by our doctors. It is sad, unfortunate and very harmful to those who are constantly suffering from uncontrolled health problems! My pleasure. If my charts are useful at all to you, or anyone else, it is just icing on the cake for me. Take care...... be well; and best of luck and good fortune! "}, "11": {"a": "51", "t": "I increased the size of my meals, still eating good quality, very healthy, low glycemic, high fiber, balanced meals, 6-7 per day. For a while, I was OK on the larger meals, but gradually I began suffering from all kinds of increased, nasty symptoms, such as swollen legs, ankles and feet; muscle weakness, loss of feeling in shoulders, weak heartbeat, fatigue, inability to exercise, etc. At first I thought that I was suffering from worsening Heart Failure, because these increased nasty symptoms could have been due to my heart disease getting worse. But, after much research, I guessed that the increased, nasty symptoms were more like signs of kidney problems, IMHO. among other dietary adjustments, and after a few days, I am feeling much better, and am experiencing improvements in ALL of these nasty symptoms. My blood pressure was still at very healthy levels. I had thought that, as long as I kept my blood pressure at very healthy levels, 24 hours per day, week after week, etc., that my blood pressure was the only thing that I had to control, or worry about. NOT!!! So...... now I can add kidney problems to my list of chronic health problems. What is the lesson learned from this? A healthy, appropriate, proper diet is the best medication that we can take for better health and treatment of health problems. During my 23+ year battle against Heart Failure and other chronic illnesses, solutions to dreadful, nasty symptoms have almost always come back to DIET! It's all good, isn't it!? "}, "12": {"a": "51", "t": "Hi flowergirl! Very true! High Blood Pressure can damage every organ and gland in one's body... pancreas, kidneys, liver, thyroid, etc. Those that can't get their blood pressure down to healthier levels are playing Russian Roulette with their health! You won't get any argument from me on that! We MUST listen to our bodies. In my case, Heart Failure combined with persistent Atrial Fibrillation, causes my body to tolerate only small amounts of carbs, proteins or fats, and absolutely no alcohol. I am currently on a 1300 calorie per day diet, consisting of seven small, low calorie meals of 48% Carbs (150 grams), 17% Proteins (55 grams) and 35% fats (50 grams) and no alcohol. My average calorie load per meal is 182! Believe me, that is not easy to do. If I exceed these calorie levels, I either suffer from Kidney related problems or Heart Failure related problems. The worst effect of going off my diet is breathing problems. Other problems are swollen ankles, legs and feet; muscle weakness and numbness, fatigue, tireness, weak heartbeat, disorientation and mental confusion; all of which result in depression and anxiety. Now that I am back on, what I consider to be, a very healthy diet, most of the negative symptoms are gone and I am feeling pretty darn good! You and I both know this for a fact, don't we!? Yet it is sooooo very difficult to stay on a healthy diet. I have been on and off my health diet many times. My blood pressure charts bear that out. When you see my blood pressure go up for a few months, that's when I started eating bigger meals, and when it then goes down to healthier levels, it's when I got back on my small meal, frequent eating healthy diet. Everyone knows the value of a healthy diet. Most either just refuse to follow a healthy diet, or just don't really know exactly what their own personal healthy diet should be. Each one of us has different dietary requirements, but our doctors treat us as \"one size fits all\". As long as our doctors don't wake up and start tailoring their patient's diets to better fit their unique Metabolic requirements, their patients will continue to be sick and their diseases will continue to get progressively worse! From what I have read, we should consume no more than .4 grams of Protein per pound of body weight. I am 5'9\", 130 pounds, so I should eat no more than (130pounds x .4Grams) = 52 grams of proteins per day. Do you know how very, VERY little protein that is!? It is very difficult! There are proteins in almost every food! Plus..... with my diet of SEVEN meals, I can only consume about 8 grams of protein with each meal! That borders on the ridiculous and the absurd!! Buts...... I do it! Aren't we ALL still learning! Except, in my case, I am learning the same lesson over and over again the hard way! I get off my diet. I suffer. I get back on my diet, I feel great! I get off my diet. I suffer. My blood pressure charts, which consists of over 29,000 bp readings, testify, on my behalf, of the great medicinal value of a good, healthy diet. This time, though, the effects of my going off my diet were so nasty that it really scared me! I am getting closer to age 70, and as I age, my system tolerates less; and I have to keep adjusting my diet as I suffer from the incurable disease of aging! Sorry, if this sounds like I got on my soapbox, but, then again, so did you! Thanks for your response. I really enjoyed reading what you had to say.

We all know that high blood pressure, if allowed to persist, can cause all kinds of major health problems, similar to the health problems that you are experiencing. Have you ever read my thread @ link: , and how well it lowered my blood pressure down to much healthier levels? I follow religiously the UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health & Wellness Center Insulin Resistance Diet, created in 2002 by Sheri Barke, MPH, RD It is a wonderful, wonderful, curative diet, IMHO; and not just for Insulin Resistance. It has also been excellent for my Heart Failure and my general health. I was doing so poorly back in 2004. This diet has made all of the difference in my health, my world, and my quality of life. Gosh, I do not have any medical training or education. I can only say what worked for me, at lowering my blood pressure down from chronic, malignant levels, all the time, to very healthy levels all the time. I follow a very restrictive, small meal, low calorie diet of around seven meals per day, totaling about 1300 calories, or an average of less than 200 calories per meal. I love my diet, and find it very tasty, but it is never enough, and I am ALWAYS hungry and forcing myself not to eat any extras. I also avoid irritants that I have learned that cause my blood pressure to go up into higher, unhealthy levels. But, even without avoiding those things, unique to my body, that cause me to suffer higher blood pressure, the main reason for my very healthy blood pressure all day long is my diet. Take care, be well, and I wish you better health! "}, "15": {"a": "51", "t": "My measurement of 1300 calories is an approximation, based on my spreadsheet. I've placed my food specs into my spreadsheet and let it figure out how much calories, calcium, potassium, fiber, protein, etc., based on servings. I don't weight foods. I just limit them. It's easy to do, but, as you say, it is very difficult to adhere to, because I always ALWAYS want to eat more! I NEVER feel full! OTOH, I eat so often that, even if I am still hungry, I know it won't be long until I am happily feeding face again! Well..... when my Heart Failure and my Beta Blocker, Coreg, are included in the equation, then it is very difficult for me to do any substantial physical activity. Yes, but considering I have Heart Failure and am taking Coreg, fatigue comes with the territory. On the brighter side, the majority of the time I really feel good, with energy, appetite, alertness and an overall good feeling. Absolutely not. I would think so. Sadly, many do not find a cure for their chronically High Blood Pressure problems. They do not realize that their glands, organs, nerves, bones, etc., are slowly being damaged, eventually resulting in Diabetes, or Thyroid problems, or Kidney problems, or Neuropathy, or Vision Problems, etc. It is such a shame and a waste since chronic, malignant High Blood Pressure is very treatable. Thanks for the encouragement! But, OTOH, motivation isn't enough! More doctors have got to stop just throwing medications at their patient's health problems and concentrate on Diet, exercise and getting their patients to avoid the irritants that trigger High Blood Pressure. Doctors could not only save the lives of countless patients, but they could improve the quality of life and wellbeing of their patients, but most doctors just won't do it! That is why I always refer people to the UCLA Arthur Ashe Student Health & Wellness Center Insulin Resistance Diet, created in 2002 by Sheri Barke, MPH, RD It is a wonderful, wonderful, curative diet, IMHO. As long as I adhere fairly close to this diet, I do very well. When I exceed the diet is when my symptoms get worse. Thank you. It's nice to read your complements. You never hesitate to be kind towards others. I just wish that more doctors would get on the bandwagon, and stop just throwing toxic medications at their patients, and start using diet, exercise and environmental/lifestyle changes, along with proper medications, to better treat their patients. Take care Flowergirl. I wish you much luck and good health. Have a great 4th of July! "}, "16": {"a": "51", "t": "There is a genetic component to EVERYONE's health. Among the first questions asked by medical professionals regards family health history. When the doctors put a label on someone's health problems, like malignant, or genetic, all it means to me is that they can't properly treat, or diagnose, their patients, so they protect their professional standing by using generalized medical definitions regarding diagnosis. I have discovered that my blood pressure goes up higher, as the calories in my meals increase , and that my blood pressure stays in very healthy levels when I keep my calories down under a certain level. This relationship between calories and blood pressure has been obvious to me many times over the past six years. How do I know? How did I learn that when calories increase, blood pressure increases, and when calories decrease, blood pressure decreases? Well...... I found out through my magnificently weak, impulsive dietary self control. As my blood pressure charts show, when I get off my low calorie diet, my blood pressure starts spiking. When I stay on my low calorie diet, my blood pressure goes back into happy land. I am not in love with this association between calories and blood pressure, but, at least, in my case, it provides me with a workable path to healthy blood pressure and a reasonably good quality of life, despite having a number of chronic, debilitating diseases. My first approach towards treating my own chronically high blood pressure problems is through restricting my calories through a small meal, frequent feeding, low glycemic diet. I am mostly a vegetarian, but I also include shrimp and eggs in my diet. I eat at 3am (99 calories), 6am (229 calories), 8:30am (269 calories), 11am (154 calories), 1:30pm (268 calories), 4pm (211 calories) and 6:30 pm (101 calories) for a total calorie load of 1331. Why do I eat so often? Well...... . two things are required for good dietary health, IMHO. One needs to limit the calories in any one meal. However, one also needs to get a healthy level of calories/nutritian over the entire day. So, what does a small meal eater do to limit calories per meal, but eat enough during the day to be healthy? The answer is, eat often... eat frequently. It is very difficult to do. My wife is an angel and is my dietary backbone. All she has to do is roll her eyes at me , and I know NOT to take that extra serving, or load up my plate. My calories are balanced into 41% carbs-fiber, 26% protein, 32% fat and no alcohol. I consume around 1162mg of salt, 1900 mg calcium, 4593mg potassium, 236 g sugar. I can't know this. , but, of course, I can't say that for sure. : I am not a nutritian, nor do I have any medical education or experience, so EVERYTHING that I post should obviously be checked with a medical professional prior to trying. I am curious, though, to know how your diet compares to the Insulin Resistance diet, and how you feel about this type of diet?

You certainly are very well informed about your own health issues, and your response was \"right on!\" . A very acceptable conclusion. As I said, I have no medical education or training, so I am just throwing out ideas, so fairly good, IMHO, but some also not particularly applicable.

I am staying with the increased medication because the two in combination, Coreg and Quinapril have been shown to significantly improve the condition of failed hearts. I figured that it would be worth it to suffer from too low of a blood pressure average if, somehow, the meds could help to repair my heart.

When one's Neurohormonal System or Immune System is under attack it causes an excess in hormones and cytokines which raises blood pressure. , . However, there are exceptions.

No fun eating. Just small salads with mostly either cereal or oatmeal; and about 3/4 of an apple per day. Those days are gone.

So..... while my quality of life has greatly improved since I lowered my blood pressure by following the four essential steps that I have documented; I still suffer and deal with these dreadful health problems.

Some times you feel better than at other times. It happens, in part, I guess, because of our Circadian Rhythm, which controls the constant onslaught of 300+ chemicals (hormones, cytokines) within our bodies 24 hours per day. Each second, minute, hour of the day, the chemical mix within our bodies changes. So...... . we may be just sitting there watching TV and get hit by a headache, or breathing problems, or fatigue, or a spike in Blood Pressure, and we wonder what the hell we did to deserve that!?

I am now up to 6 sets of the following exercises: We also do two half hour power walks per day to music. I know that I have Heart Failure, Permanent Atrial Fibrillation and latent Chronically High Blood Pressure, but nearing age 70, I feel like a much younger man. The combination of the following has lowered my blood pressure down to permanently healthy levels and greatly improved my health and well-being: I realize that if I stop doing any one of the four daily rituals both my blood pressure and my health would suffer. What forces me to continue with these rituals every day, regardless of how well I feel, is that I know if I don't I will suffer, once again, from chronically high blood pressure and deteriorating health. During 1998, my blood pressure averaged 152/97! That means that every day, day after day, I suffered from extremely unhealthy blood pressure almost all of the time! No matter what I did, no matter how many times my doctor changed my medications, no matter how many tests my doctors ran, we just couldn't get my stupid, chronic unexplained high blood pressure down to healthy levels. From 1999 thru 2001 we were able to get my average blood pressure down around 146/92, due to medication increases, but it was still too high and unhealthy. Then, during 2002 and 2003, I suffered from higher blood pressure (around 151/94) and worsening symptoms of weakness, sweating, constant breathing problems, chest pains, mental confusion, edema, etc. That wasn't just occasional higher blood pressure. That was unhealthy, dangerous, high blood pressure almost all the time, day after day, month after month, year after year! My average Blood Pressure from 2007 through 2011 has been 124/72 based on 9,817 readings. That means that my blood pressure has been excellent day after day, month after month, year after year over the past 5 years. So...... I religiously maintain a healthy diet, exercise, take my medication and avoid things. I never want to return to those nasty, uncomfortable days of uncontrollable high blood pressure. Never!

My biggest complaint is that I can't get the news on their big screen TV in the waiting room. Instead I have to watch constant pictures of the dentist family's expensive vacations, over and over again in a seemingly endless loop.

I hope that, most of the time, your blood pressure is doing pretty good. An occasional high reading is OK, in my book, because there are so many common ordinary things that we contact throughout the day, that can drive up blood pressure. One advantage I have for getting my blood pressure down to healthy levels is that I have Heart Failure and Permanent Atrial Fibrillation. In order to co-exist with these nasty diseases, I have to live in a pseudo bubble. I have no choice. If I want to feel good most of the time, I have to give up a lot of things that others take for granted, and I have to live a somewhat spartan lifestyle. That's why I get so excited about being able to \"eat\" a bag of popcorn without swallowing, and get away with it! It's finally something that I can eat which is fun, and not just veggies, a little fruit, cereal and oatmeal ALL THE DAMN TIME! What meds do you take for your blood pressure? Same to you.

It has to be triggered by environment/lifestyle. What you have clarified is that SOME people have genes that are more easily triggered. If a person has a family history of a certain disease, they likely need to live a near-perfect lifestyle to try to avoid that disease. That's what I'm trying to do because I had one grandparent with diabetes and lots of relatives with cancer. But it's not uncommon to hear people ask: \"Why are you so strict with your diet? Don't you want to have any fun?\" If you already have a disease, no one will say a word. They figure that you have to eat a special diet because of your condition. However, if you say that you're trying to avoid getting cancer or diabetes, they don't really understand. But that's another story. Is it safe to say that every disease has a corresponding gene associated with it? I think the answer is yes. If that's true, when it comes to diabetes, cancer or other degenerative diseases, the only thing we really need to talk about is \"lifestyle\". How can one ever establish exactly how strict or careful a lifestyle needs to be? I guess the answer is that no one ever knows for sure. If one lives a less than perfect lifestyle and nothing bad shows up on their yearly physical, they can say: \"Well, I'm okay so far.\" Some people will insist that they eat good diets and get exercise.

Dr. Lora says it's like making a path through the woods. The more you walk on the path the more it gets beaten down & forms a path. I've taken biofeedback classes to no avail because of the alpha/beta blocker prevents them from working properly. The best I've come up with is to use extra meds.

I feel ok at the docs but internally my body is not at all ok with it.

Hmmm...not sure I understand the difference between the selective v. non selective beta blockers. I think I have heard both clonidine and propranolol used for emotional triggered rosacea flaring with propranolol being used more frequently and perhaps more effectively.While I probably do have some allergic reactions going on with certain foods with histamines--my real problem is dealing with the anxiety(read Medically related) triggered rosacea flaring. Do you understand why propranolol would work for this and if it reduces blood flow to my face--does this mean that blood flow is reduced to my brain--which I would think is not great for cognitive functioning. Of course, this would be on an occassional basis, not daily. But, would that be so that it would reduce blood flow to the brain? "}, "7": {"a": "8610", "t": "Access-- Ok, I'll check out Merck. The further I have looked it seems though that there are contradictory research results with rosacea patients using propranolol , and that in one study they had to increase the dose to get the anti-flushing results--but I couldn't get the whole article to see what the dose had to be increased to. They did mention that a good portion of the people then dropped out of the study because of neg. effects of the drug. Soooo...I wonder then if I would get into the dangerous dosage as far as conversion of t43 to t3 is concerned with that drug . The other drug I have seen for this is clonidine and now I will have to see if that is in the same class as propranolol and whether there is the t4 to t3 issue--do you know?I have heard of microdoses of clonidine being used by some derms between laser treatments with rosacea patients to minimize flaring while they are healing from the treatment. Well, one little weird gem I ran across yesterday in looking for propranolol results was an article called\" A pill to forget? Can a Medication suppress traumatic memories\"It was a 60 minutes clip with a full article attached and it was fascinating. Studies being conducted to see if one lessens the effect of ptsd if after the trauma, propranolol is given because the adrenaline(epinepherine) is suppressed and this seems to effect the nastiness of the traumatic memory that is embedded. It was extremely interesting, would love to hear your comments---maybe I wouldn't have such nasty memories of the dr. office visit or the painful biopsy if I had had propranolol before/during /after.

Well....my derm nixed the idea of propranolol for flushing , she doesn't think it works. And, the research is inconsistent. I think she was also spooked over monitoring someone in case bp goes too low.I can see her concern but she has left me with nothing to try. .

Access-thanks for mentioning the alternative drug vistaril --I will take a look . But what I was most concerned with was getting the flushing down and I wonder is that just for the anxiety or would it possibly have the adrenaline blocking aspect. I think I need to get a second opinion from another derm. Do you have any thoughts whether the rosacea could be thyroid or autoimmune related, or post meno estrogen related...I have read of a person thinking going on hrt stopped her rosacea--well it hasn't worked for me yet. .

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your response. I did get my biopsy results and it reads: Right neck nodule,fine needle aspiration cytology. -Consistent with origin in thyroid, low probability of neoplasm. See comment. Comment:Aspirate smears shows follicular cells, Hurthle cells and abundant lymphocytes. Colloid is also identified. The findings are consistent with lymhpocytic/Hashimoto's thyroiditis. No malignant cells are seen. AND the FNA U/S report--- The previously identified 3x1x1 cm solid lobular right neck mass like structure adjacent to or projecting from the right thyroid lobe is again identified without evidence of significant interval change. The adjacent right thyroid measures 2.5x1x.09cm with diffusely heterogeneous echotexture and approx. 4 small (3-8mm) echogenic solid nodules without evidence for significant interval change. The left thryoid measure 2.9x1x1cm and appears stable with diffusely heterogeneous echotexture but without discrete focal mass effect . No psammomatous calcifications are present. And a ct scan shows-- along the more inferior aspect of the rt. thyroid gland and just lateral to the thyroid gland and between the rt. common carotid and rt. vertebral arteries ,a soft tissue nodule most suggestive of a lymph node that measures 0.7x1.3x0.9 cm.Other small lymph nodes are demonstrated along the bilateral anterior cervical chains are sub cent. in size. And a sestamibi-showed very little functional thyroid tissue to take up the thyroid pertechnetate tracer. My endo seems to have given up on putting the bits of info together. And, while the biopsy came back benign....I have my appt. with the thyroid cancer spec. at the univ. who has had another radiologist review all cts. from Mar. and June and the U/S's and the sestamibi. Also they are requesting the tissue slides to look at those again. So, I expect that at the end of this month if all goes as planned, someone will have looked over everything and then there will be a plan based on the info. This has really been a long drawn out process to say the least. But having heard stories from some thyroid cancer surviviors, I am glad that there was no rush with the first surgeon's plan to just remove the mass and rt. lobe and then see if malignancy shown then take left lobe too. Otherwise to leave the left lobe. I still think the whole thing should go. It is not like saving the left lobe is saving a viable functioning lobe--the sestamibi showed little functioning thyroid tissue. OK----now about the effects all this is having on my face. Yes, I am seeing a dermatologist and she scripted noritate which is like metrogel but in a cream--my skin is very dry. Sometimes I think the noritate is irritating and have to lay off of it for awhile. Maybe it helps a smidgen-- I do not have a bp prob. at all and my lipid profile is great. I do get white coat hypertension. So, if I took a beta blocker for the emotional triggered rosacea flare it would just be on the occassion of a med appt/diagnostic procedure. If I understand you , you are not taking the beta blocker for bp and it is just for the rosacea flare--is that right?? So now you say the propranolol /inderal---(same drug I think) was useless--was that useless as it related to your bp or rosacea? The pindolol being short acting and short lived in your system from the roasacea flaring viewpoint sounds just like what I need. Could you just clarify it is for the rosacea and not the bp that you are using it for??? Thank you so much!!! And, do you think your thyroid is going to be with you for awhile yet??

Then when I talked to my endo she said yes that would be an excellent choice at Mayo. My endo says my pcp should make the referral. I called Mayo and they said either pcp or endo can do the referral to Gharib it doesn't matter.Or self referral but dr. referral best. I agree with most of what you said about Mayo , I have been there 2 times about 2 yrs. ago.I self referred. Sad to say I wasn't as satisfied with my endo as you were .

Picture books are the fav. I hate that most times we have to spoon feed our MDs. But if that is what you have to do til you find that special MD willing to go above and beyond. SO be it. Do it.

The best foods to choose are those which output glucose more slowly. Combine your daily fats intake with the meals where you eat faster carbs like potatoes, fruit, etc. The fats will slow down the metabolism of the carbs for you and keep your sugar lower over time. The main thing to remember is not to waste your carbs on \"empty\" calories like refined sugar, candy, or white bread, etc. Choose your carbs from good food sources like beans and brown rice, potatoes, corn, vegetables, and fruits. Foods which can bring you good nutrients as well as calories. If you want to gain or maintain weight, the combination which will work is to take higher doses of hypoglycemics or insulin while increasing your carb intake. This will keep your sugar levels down and add food stores to your body. Don't let go of exercise to do it. You don't want to build weight all in fat, you want at least some of your weight gain to go into smooth muscle. A good source of extra calories is Ensure or similar dietary aids, especially those formulated for slower glucose output like Glucerna. They contain lots of good nutrition which is going to be essential for you as you undergo cancer treatments.

First of all I hardly think 110 is a spike in your sugar, 150 or 190 seems likemore of a spike, but Cora was right about mornings being high when you generally have it awhile. Checking BS when you first wake up is meaning when you open your eyes. The longer you wait to test the higher your sugar will go. That is probably what your experiencing. Sometimes I grab a few grapes as I want to have my coffee befor I eat in the am. Whole grain bread still has a lot of carbs. You have to find the Stone ground which has little carbs if you have to eat bread. Or just use one slice depending on carbs and bread you choose. I happen to hate ww bread but I do use it for toast or I use two Wasa crackers as they are about 8 carbs each and filling. They say keep your numbers under 150 as after that damage is being done little by little. So it's good your on top of that. Keep walking everyday and you might be able to stay off meds with a good diet or way of life I say. I stayed off meds for 10 years till I had a hip problem and couldn't walk like I used to. All the books say you can do it so do it as long as you can. Remember test as soon as you wake up, you will probably see a big difference in your numbers.Good luck to you "}, "1": {"a": "651", "t": "I am not sure if your just laying there, if your sugar will rise? I guess you might try testing it, keep your tester next to your bed and see what happens? I don't think if you wake up at 4 you need to check if your not getting up for the day. I wake up early sometimes, but I go back to sleep, if I don't I told you I have some carbs when I get up to put my coffee on like a few grapes to stop sugar from rising. You see you go all night without food or drink so sugar rises with no food all that time. I keep some grapes or something small to eat next to my bed and that helps me. Most diabetics have a problem sooner or later with the high sugars in the am, but some don't.

Yes, you need to get up and walk everyday even if it is only 15 min, it helps with your weight and your BS. You will see that when you indulge in carbs or sweets, you seem to want more and more, at least that is how it effects me. Once you make up your mind to start a plan you will just do it and drop a few pounds and be happy about it. Metformin is good but may give you stomach upsets at first. Stick with it because it does help. It won't make you skinny, only you can do that Lol. Diabetics should eat several small meals a day so plan your snacks and carbs around eating. It should be three meals, three snacks but you can make more small snacks if your hungry. Look for things with no carbs to get you through the hunger pangs, like I mentioned above.

I dont have much motivation to exercise now, I didnt do anything all week but sit on my butt and do some house cleaning...I hate feeling this way and need to change my attitude and just do it. (easier said then done) My Dr. said that I have a fatty liver from having high cholesterol and high blood sugars and that everything I eat turns into fat! that is why I cannot lose the weight. By taking the Metformin it should bring down my numbers when I eat so that I dont get that fatty stuff and it should help to curb my appetite as well because I'm hungry every 2 to 3 hours...have you heard about that?

I just want to be of support and help since we both have PCOS and I took metformin and you are taking it now. Are you going to continue the HCG shots and going in for u/s? Or are you waiting till the insurance kicks back in? If you are waiting on the insurance, and all you are going to be doing is taking the metformin, I suggest getting a basal body thermometer and watching your temperatures. According to my MD when your temp actually rises, you have already ovulated. Also, watch your cervical mucus, and if it is really thick, you can get cough medicine with guafenisin (sp?) in it and it will help thin out the mucus. Let me know if you have any questions. I have a friend who has the same thing and her RE gave her metformin and clomid together. By the way all we did was took the metformin. Actually, I kind of stopped thinking about getting pg I was just happy that I was having a normal period every 4 weeks like clockwork. Then, it all blew up and the office I was working in (to begin with by myself) I had been working there 2 years alone and was beginning to need help. The administrator let me pick who I wanted to help me, she came to work for me in May knowing that I had been ttc for about 5 years, and while I know it was not her fault, can you believe after she started working for me in May than one Monday morning I went in to work in June and she was holding a positive pg test in my face. It was all I could do not to cry, needless to say I spent alot of time in the bathroom crying that day. However, then next month I was pg too. I truly know what you are going through.

But it seems pycgnogol may have unique properties of its own... tamuprof45 "}, "2": {"a": "10094", "t": "Hello Boots! Wow! What a post. As usual, it's full of insights. Thank you for taking the time to type it. It must have taken quite a while. I heard another alternative medicine success story from a co-worker just today. It blew my mind. She is quite younger than I with a young daughter. Because she had four large stones in her gallbladder and was in a great deal of pain, she was told her gallbladder would have to be removed. She told to the doctors there was no way they were taking any of her bodyparts out. Went to a naturopath, who treated her with natural products (I forgot which ones). Follow-up scan sometime later confirmed the stones, with the exception of a small fraction of one, had dissapeared. Needless to say, this lady is a great believer in alternative medicine now. I keep hearing more and more such stories from people that I know and whom I trust. It's really quite incredible. I am so glad the herbs are making such a positive difference in your life. Many of today's synthetically produced drugs were originally derived from botanicals which grow in tropical rainforests and elsewhere on the planet. These were the only cures available until relatively recently. The knowledge of the healing powers of herbs, roots and leaves in certain conditions was surprisingly extensive. It's all slowly coming back now. Boots, I have not found that particular study you mentioned. I got distracted while looking for it, and then forgot about it. I now have a reminder to myself written right here where I can't miss it. I still plan on doing it. I think the carrot & apple juice drinks reducing one's cholesterol sound intriguing. How nice it would be to discontinue at least one drug, even if it meant one has to drink carrot juice every day for life. I read just today that people who take Lipitor (I do) would get the same results with no toxicity if they took 3000-6000mg of vitamin C instead of the drug. I went to check my bottle of vitamin C supplements rightaway to see how strong they were. What I take is almost nothing. That's a lot of vitamin C that would be needed daily. I don't take much because the dietitian at the hospital did not think I needed to. I have since read many articles regarding heart health and vitamin C and think I should be taking more of it. Carrots provide vitamin C and beta carotene it its natural form. So it all makes sense. I don't have a sore thumb so far and hope I never will. I've heard enough about gout to scare me for life. I am having some problems with my knee. I am quite sure it's medicine-related. Most of my medications can cause muscle and joint problems, pain or discomfort. You are so right. Medications cause us to develop deficiencies in nutrients, minerals and enzymes, or cause excessive amounts of these in our blood or plasma levels. Then everything goes haywire as the body's chemistry is changed forever. My husband loves linden tea and we buy the teabags whenever we can find them. We also buy chamomile tea. I have never seen or heard of yarrow tea. I'll look around. A cup of good herbal tea once in a while can't hurt. With the weather getting colder now where we live, we'll be drinking more hot beverages. take care, flowergirl "}, "3": {"a": "10094", "t": "I can't believe all the good things I've read about pycnogenol. It's a shame this natural product is virtually unknown. They say it's an effective alternative to beta blockers and ACE Inhibitors with similar cardiovascular and blood pressure lowering properties, and that it counteracts the damage to the heart from hypertension (cardiac remodeling).

They can often be just as effective as the regular meds. Did you know that celery seed is a natural diuretic? I first heard of its use in lowering blood pressure when travelling to visit my son earlier this year. I talked to a person who uses it daily. It's supposed to work very well in reducing blood pressure. My total cholesterol was good when last tested. (Lipitor & diet). The HDL is low. I hope it doesn't drop. I won't get tested again until next year. I was told by a specialist (two different ones, actually) that I have to remain on Lipitor, regardless of my cholesterol levels. Apparently, it helps with the kidneys (I forget how, exactly, though it was explained to me), and it protects from plaque-buildup (when combined with aspirin). That does not mean I can't drink carrot juice. Something else worries me now. I can't stick with my proven diet now that I am working again - have 2 fruits on breaks & 1 veggie with lunch, and, maybe, one more fruit in the evening for dessert. Considerably less than the usual 8 servings (or more) I had on my diet. No more daily oatmeal for breakfast, either. Therefore, no flaxseed, cinnamon or berries. I don't want to risk restenosis and higher cholesterol levels by not adhering to the diet. I find it extremely difficult to eat all the things I am supposed to. I'll have to give this some thought and try to figure something out. Thank you for your insights, Boots.

I definitely think that certain medications can contribute to Glucose tolerance. The medication I was taking at the time was BYSTOLIC. I've taken TOPROL in the past and did not experience any changes with my glucose tolerance. (Though I was a little younger at the time) TOPROL did lower my HDL cholesterol and raised my cholesterol. The beta blockers which are not suppose to effect glucose metabolism are: COREG, LABETAOLOL and BYSTOLIC. As I mentioned, the jury is still out for BYSTOLIC (as far as my numbers are concerned). Perhaps my numbers were a fluke and possibly due to an increase in weight, (which is definitely beta blocker related). The HBP medications which are known to improve glucose tolerance are: MICARDIS (definitely), BENICAR, DIOVAN, COZAAR, ALTACE, ENALAPRIL and Perindpril (Probably). I am currently taking a beta-blocker known as KERLONE (Betaxolol). It will be interesting to see my glucose numbers at my next check-up. As far as tolerabilty, KERLONE is excellent (possibly the best beta blocker, though not at all popular) This beta blocker is also marketed as Eye drops (for gluacoma). It is manufactured by SANOFI pharm. (France). Joint pains and fatigue are much less then some of the other beta blockers I've taken. Quality of life is not affected either. What needs to be seen now is my blood test results, blood pressure control and heart rate control. (BYSTOLIC is superb for heart rate control). KERLONE is almost identical to TOPROL but without certain side effects such as sweating and certain vague pains. (We need to choose among the worse of the evil side effects we can live with) P.S. The supplement \"Chromium Picolinate\" available cheaply at most drug stores and food market chains, has been proven in many scientific studies and respected medical journals to greatly improve glucose tolerance. An added bonus is a 10 - 15&#37; increase in HDL cholesterol (especially when taken with NIACIN). Another popular Chromium blend is called Chromium GTF, which I believe is bound to NIACIN. My mom's aunt was told by her doctor to take a Chromium supplement about 30 years ago, (I would sometimes purchase them for her) She had a heart condition among some other conditions when she was younger. To make a long story short, she lived till 98 years old, and swore by this vitamin... "}, "1": {"a": "9278", "t": "Flowergirl, The drug KERLONE is known as BETAXOLOL, which is a highly selective beta1 blocker, with no ISA. Closely identical to BISOPROLOL and moderately lipophilic similar to METOPROLOL/TOPROL. It also has some CALCIUM Antagonism, similar to TIMOLOL, and is a mild vasodilator (according to some research studies). My doctor was not to keen on prescribing this beta blocker. Mainly due to the fact, that it is not even remotely popular in this country. He later stated, that he likes the drugs properties which include all the METOPROLOL similarities, most important that it is a beta1 blocker. I learned of this drug on WEB-MD which quoted some respected authors as stating that this is one of the only drugs in the beta blocker class with almost no sexual side effects or impairments on quality of life. The other pill was ISRADIPINE a calcium blocker and DIOVAN an ARB. They stated that almost every other medication class has been known to cause sexual side effects (some happening over time). Keep in mind, that this still only relates to a small (reported) population. Also, many persons never report these side effects and most drugs are rarely tested for these side effects. Quality of life is the primary reason (the article states) that most hypertensive patients ditch their medicine and refuse any other medicines. The estimates are that more than 60&#37; of men discontinue their medications, and an even greater % of both men and women have poorly controlled blood pressure (even those taking medication). I think the best move is to always try and work with your doctor, and if one medicine doesn't agree with you, there are many others. "}, "2": {"a": "9278", "t": "I think alot has to do with $$$ for research studies. METOPROLOL/TOPROL has been proven in over 90&#37; of research studies to prevent MI's, improve heart function, improve Ejection fraction, prevent sudden death, improve heart failure etc. It appears to be the model beta blocker which all future beta blockers would like to copy. PROPRANOL was the first beta blocker, to show proof of it's benefits. Are all beta blockers similar?? Most beta blockers appear to provide similar benefits such as TIMOLOL, ACEBUTOLOL, CARVEDILOL and BETAXOLOL. Though the studies conducted on these beta blockers were much smaller (except for CARVEDILOL). CARVEDILOL is always trying to compare itself with METOPROLOL in large studies. CARVEDILOL boasts that the benefits of their beta blocker are either equal or greater than METOPROLOL. Keep in mind, these CARVEDILOL studies are funded mostly by the CARVEDILOL folks. Also, they seem to use METOPROLOL instead of TOPROL XL which has shown dramatic benefits in the heart failure studies. ATENOLOL appears to be the most popular prescribed medication in Europe and elsewhere. All new BP pills on the market seem to compare their new pill to ATENOLOL and always try to boast better results. I think they choose ATENOLOL over METOPROLOL because ATENOLOL can't boast the dramatic mortality benefits. A beta blocker called BUCINDOLOL (pretty popular in Europe at one time) showed almost no benefit at all in research studies. Results were = to a placebo pill. P.S. I think it is a doctor's job to prescribe the pill which can provide the greatest level of proven benefit. Side effects are secondary. On a personal note, I have never had any quality of life problem's with TOPROL if the dose is kept small enough. When the dosage gets > than 100 mg trouble starts. Luckily, most of us can tolerate these lower doses, and see good blood pressure results. "}, "3": {"a": "10094", "t": "I thought you were a member of the Weight Watchers. Eating a healthy diet is not easy. Figuring out which healthy foods to eat and which ones to stay away from can be a real challenge. I am supposed to follow conflicting diets - for instance: no red meat to maintain cholesterol levels, while eating LOTS of the same red meat to build up my non-existent iron stores, while watching total protein intake (which consuming the meat increases). You get the picture. Bananas have too much potassium and are sweet to boot. I used to make a smoothie with a banana and a handful of blueberries. I don't anymore. The doctor says that's too sweet. I know your diet is a healthy one with hardly any room for improvement. Don't worry about your weight. That is what I am told. Try to increase your exercise level by walking extra steps throughout the day. They add up. I walk for an hour a day, which is all I can handle right now. It is not enough. My blood pressure was perfect before, during and after the surgery. I had not taken any medication that morning and felt quite dehydrated by lunchtime, which is when the surgery was performed. I had to use the bathroom frequently in spite of the long fast and no drink for 16 hours. That's why I felt so thirsty. I am happy to hear your thyroid is OK and no surgery is required at this time. I hope for the same for your daughter. Have you ever mentioned your blood pressure levels to your doctor, and what did she have to say about them? Did she also tell you they were fine? What is your average nightly systolic and diastolic? I still think mine are too low. I will ask my nephrologist when I see him next month. I read that blood pressure that's too low can damage the kidneys more - gives rise to a higher risk for kidney disease progression. flowergirl "}, "4": {"a": "10094", "t": "I agree with you, ACE - it's good to have \"~options~\" when selecting one's medication. We get to pick and choose which side effects are more to our liking. Seeing that others face the same challenges of day to day living with the side effects of our medications, yet keep looking for ways to cope, makes me feel better. Remaining optimistic can be difficult at times, especially when new issues develop as a result of taking the medication. Imagining where some of us would be without the medication usually helps overcome any negative feelings. I like the fact that you're sticking with the same drug class and are willing to try different drugs belonging to this drug group, rather than changing drug classes. What many people don't realize is that there are likely to be some side effects with any drugs, regardless of the drug class they belong to. There are many differences between the individual beta blockers. I've never heard of the one you mention. I have looked it up. Unlike labetalol, which I was on in the past, it is cardioselective in smaller (normal) doses. I took labetalol for six months. The 800mg dose, combined with my other medications, caused my shortness of breath become too severe to live with. It will be interesting to watch your progress and find out how well this beta blocker works for you. I hope you will keep us informed. As for the other meds you mention, I am on the highest possible dose of an ACE inhibitor and seem to be allergic to ARBs for some reason. Rather than changing any of the existing drugs, a new drug has been to my drug regimen for the glucose issue. I am still looking into this and hope I can somehow help normalize the glucose by adjusting my diet. P.S. Many thanks for your suggestions. I will discuss them with my pharmacist first.

You would think that the doctors would do anything in their power to work with the patients, assuring compliance and helping maintain a reasonable standard of living. You are very considerate in deciding to share this information with others. It is good to know there are some drugs people can actually live with.

I also read A LOT of info on the internet about continuing metformin when you are pregnant to hold the pregnancy - currently, there are many ongoing studies about that and preliminary results seems to show that it is effective. I asked my fertility specialist about that and he said that the reason why he does not support that (yet) is because using metformin during pregnancy is still in the early stages of research and there are currently no studies to show what will happen to your baby years from now. So to be on the safe side, he does not prescribe that. In fact, as soon as I confirmed I was pg, I was told to stop the metformin. Since I had a lot of problems with my lining prior to conceiving (the 4 months of spotting/bleeding caused by a lining that never formed properly) he put me on progesterone suppositories and HCG injections until the end of the first trimester. The purpose of these two is to help my lining stay thick and healthy and to help \"hold\" the baby. I also did a lot of research on both drugs and the result was that my original concerns etc. were put to rest. Originally I was concerned about taking the HCG (Profasi) because a website I found said that it was KNOWN to cause birth defects if taken while during pregnancy. After more research, I learned that it is commonly used by fertility specialists (eg people who have IVF) to help hold a pregnancy - and is safe in low dosages.

You need an eating plan that does. First though, let me make sure that you understand what insulin resistance IS. The insulin process works like this: When you eat carbohydrates, glucose is released into the blood stream. This, in turn, triggers an insulin response. Insulin converts some of the glucose into glycogen and hauls it off to the liver and muscle tissue for temporary storage for use when blood sugar falls. Since short term storage capacity is limited, any excess glucose is converted by the insulin into triglycerides (that's fat to you and me ) for long term storage. Ok...still following? When blood sugar drops, glucagon is produced and it trots off to the liver and grabs the stored glycogen from short term storage and dumps it back into the bloodstream to be converted back to glucose, thus cranking your blood sugar back up. This is all well and good, AS LONG AS blood sugar is released into the bloodstream which in turn means a controlled release of insulin. comes into play when a diet rich in high-glycemic carbos (and sugar) is eaten. These carbohydrates are converted to glucose nearly instantly which means an equal amount of insulin is triggered. The excess insulin results in sharp drop of blood sugar - which makes you feel tired, therefore craving more fuel (carbohydrates) and voila! you have a vicious cycle with: > consistently high insulin levels > insulin working overtime to reduce excess glucose but can't keep up therefore, bang! you gain weight > cells stop responding to insulin and won't store excess fat > excess glucose therefore can't be converted to fat and stays in bloodstream where it's veddy veddy bad for your heart, kidneys, eyes, blood vessels, nerves. Still with me? You need low glycemic foods and cut out the SUGAR! You need to eat more apples and fewer grapes, for example. Or more celery and fewer carrots. AND you need to cut out refined sugar and it's analogs (no cakes! no cookies! no meal replacement bars, etc). Research shows that the ONLY sweetener which does NOT trigger an insulin response, is Stevia. All the others do. Yes, that means aspartame, sweet n low, and even Splenda. So no soda pop! What you need, IMHO, is the Fat Flush Plan (FFP) which is designed to restore balance to your daily diet AND to control insulin levels by emphasizing low-glycemic foods and the importance of eating lean protein to help slow absorption (and eating protein burns fat. WAhoooooo!) . Several of my friends who suffer from PCOS have done quite well on the FFP and not only that, they FEEL so much better. I highly recommend it.

It is my understanding that SBD allows things such as sugar-free jello and dairy, the former which is made with sugar substitutes that trigger an insulin response and the latter which has a natural sugar (lactose) which also triggers an insulin response. In addition, I believe SBD allows tropical fruits in the second phase, which are very high in sugar and can also trigger insulin. I understand that some folks love SBD and do very well.

Neuropathy is simply a \"disease of the nervous system\" - but the type, cause, severity, speed of onset, and permanance can vary. Typical diabetic neuropathy occurs after years of poor glucose control - the nerves become damaged as a result of improper metabolism. But short-term neuropathy occur - can be caused by just about anything - if the cell structure or permiability of the nerves are altered, symptoms can occur. Some of the things other than diabetes that cause this include vitamin deficiencies (usually Bs), kidney or liver disease, infection, physical injury (nerve compression or swelling), metabolism of glucose, and increased toxicity (which can result from medications, alcohol, or environmental factors). Trying to identify the cause can be near impossible. The best place to start is to look at what has changed when the symptoms began, especially if they began suddenly. If you just started the metformin, it is VERY possible that your symptoms are from the medication. But if you dramatically changed your diet at the same time, that could contribute as well.

Then they told me I am dehydrated...again. I am always tired after they do labwork. Anyways, I am back to taking Vicodin (it was in my beach bag...I must be retarded) because the pain just got to out of hand last night. I started having these horrible stabbing pains, and then the started going over to where I think my gallbladder used to be. Felt almost like anothe gallbladder attack. Got me to wondering if everything I am going through is all related, or is it some sort of huge coincidence that it is all happening at the same time. I am absolutely horrible, but I will press on. Planning on going and taking a nap for a little bit before going back to work. Not really wanting to go tonight, but I must. My mom wants me to quit, said that it is horrible for me, especially since tehy don't give breaks. I am not one ot give up on something I start. I started this job for the summer, and i plan on sticking it out, well, as long as tehy will let me. If I have to have some sort of procedure, they might not like it, and tell me that I am requesting to much time off. But the boss was impressed yesterday. Hopfully I can hold out my shift today, and keep and and stuff, and he will like me, so he won't get rid of me. Here's hoping! Hopefully you can start to get some more sleep! Sleep is amazing, and so important when you aren't feeling great. Although, I must say it isn't a great hiding place either to get away from the pain. But, it is still nice to have. Hang in there!! 2plus, sorry about the confusion. It is a good idea not to self medicate. I must say, I did fall into that trap at one point, because I couldn't handle the pain, but then I was questioned, but once the doctors figured out waht was causing the pain, they were understanding. The pain pills actually give me migraines, and right now, I am not sure what is worse. The headaches, or teh pain. But, I get headaches that are pretty bad without the pain medicine, so I am just trying not to aggrivate the situation, but at the same time help the pain.

Good thing I got up and found a new doctor before hearing from him again. Let me just say, I don't think I am going there again for a long time. I used to have a good doctor in that office, but that was a couple of years ago. Oh well, I have a good doctor now here at home. Thanks guys for all that you have done for me!

He told me the best we could do was do another CT scan to check and see whether or not there are any stones that are moving. He put me back on Flomax for another week. I go back to see him on the 15th. I have the CT scan on the 13th. Sounds ok to me I guess. I will never understand the medical profession. Why did he leave the stone in the ureter if he removed two others? I am not sure. Anyways, he told me to stay on the Vicodin, and just come back next Friday. So, another week and a half to find out some answers. Oh, the first doctor I went to called while I was gone, and they are now closed so I have no idea what they wanted to tell me.

The call I missed was from the first doctor's office I had went to and hadn't heard from since. I have no idea what that was about. They said they will track down who called me, and give me a call back. Last night was absolutely horrible. Could barely sleep. The pain in my pelvic area was so bad that I just kept taking vicodin, and reheating my rice bag, and the pain just never went away. My sides still hurt as well, but not near as much as the other. Yeah, going to school with my mom was cool. She graduated college the same year I graduated from high school, so I changed colleges after that, because there was not really a point going there anymore since I was out of high school, and my mom was out of college. It was a fun couple of years though that I was there. I really hope that you start getting better, and that you can get back into the things you used to be into. Being a medical mess is no fun. I know how hard going to school at the same time is. Right now I am on final academic probation, because I have to miss so much school,. and I have been sick with various things every semester I have been in this school. None of them seem to be related, which is making the doctors crazy. I have been having horrible headaches as well. Nothing I can do to get rid of them! Making me totally crazy.

I have pretty much spent all day in bed, rolling around. In a lot fo pain, but I don't know what to do about it. The doctor from the first place I went called, and gave me the results fo the ultrasound I had done. He said that it showed no kidney stones, so therefore I shouldn't be in pain. I told him the pain was worse, and he just said to wait a few days to see if it persisted, and then come in if it didn't get better. That doctor is out of his mind!! He said that the pelvic pain shouldn't be there unless the stone was moving, and he was like, it isn't kidney stones if it is in both sides. Yeah, I was kinda just ready to hang up on him. It did surprise me that he called me himself though. That is rare, I think. Oh well. I really hope that when you get this stent out, it can stay out. I am so sorry to hear that you have had so many of them. I feel like I have been such a big baby about things. Ihave only had one in for a few days, and I was going crazy. Really hoping that things get better for you!! I did find out that my stones were calcium-oxalate, and they gave me the diet for that. Sad thing is, almost oeverything on the list that it says don't eat was a staple in my diet. Soymilk, peanut butter, tea, hot cocoa, and all the berries and juices.

Last night it got so bad that I just sat on the front porch and cried with her, and she just told me to go and lay down in her bed (instead of the couch), and try to fall asleep. She slept in my sisters bed, and my dad had to go to the hospital overnight for a sleep apnea test, so I just layed in my moms room until 3 am, when I finally fell asleep, and woke back up around 6. I don't really have a choice with the ER. My parents think that all teh hospital is going to do is give me somethig for pain and send me home with a huge bill. They act like it isn't worth it.

I am so tired of the pain, and then the migraines that come along with taking the pain meds. I am also tired of worrying my little sister who sits there and is upset to see me hurting. My parents don't outwardly show anything until the doctor mentions surgery again. Then they are just all up and worried. I am about to go and lay down for a bit. Only two hours before the doctor, so hopefully he will have some type of answer for me. Maybe something in the labwork, anything at this point. I just want the pain to end. Sorry to keep going on. I am just venting it out. Yeah, that doctor has some serious issues with stupidity. I was so upset when we were talking!! And then he just ated like there was absolutely nothing wrong with me, and I was basically making it all up. Yeah, because I would do that!! Not! I am changing my diet! Anytime anyone in the family cooks, I have the list on the fridge so that they can tell me when to avoid a certain food.

I got the results yesterday. There is nothing wrong with my kidneys according to the lab work (I had the CT scan today, so I won't get those results for a little bit). I am slightly anemic, and my cholesterol and tryglicerides are a little tiny bit high, but other than that, it showed that I am pretty healthy, which is nice to hear! I am also not as dehydrated as I was a month ago! I have been making it a point to try and drink more, so it seems that it is working. I told the doctor that I needed a new pain medication, because I was tired of the migraines that come with it. I told him no percocet or vicodin, because both of those gave me horrible headaches. Then, he told me that the only other option we could try was morphine, so he prescribed that. I don't know, but it seems that the headaches would be worse with that. he is also worried about my still being nauseated all of the time, two months after having my gallbladder removed. He does't have a clue as to what could be causing that. I thaught it was still getting used to not having it that was making me sick. Not really sure. Hopefully I will get the results today, or else it will probably be on Monday, hopefully no later than that. I will keep you posted. How did your kidney blow up?? That stinks! I am so sorry that that happened. Ouch! Yeah my mom is worried. I hate that I am worrying her. Also, she isn't really all that willing to allow me to go on the morphine. It is her money paying for it, so I don't really have all that much of a choice in the matter. I don't really know how I feel about taking it anyways to tell you the truth.

I was happy to hear the good results on my labwork. That is like the first itme in forever that it was anywhere close to normal!! As for the pain meds, I am only taking them as recommended, sometimes less if I can stand it (right now I am doing without because my mom won't get the morphine until the pain has me on my knees pretty much). I know that I have not become addicted, but I just don't want that to happen. All my freinds and family are worried that it could happen. Everyone told my mom that I shouldn't take the morphine, and therefore she won't get it for me, and I have like absolutely no money, and therefore cannot get it.

Finding it hard to distinguish between cramps from my period and pelvic pain caused by the kidney stones. I have really bad PCOS, which I am kinda worried about right now as my family cannot afford the birth control I have to be on for it, because I can't take anything strong at all, for fear of a stroke or worse migraines, and the last time I didn't have birth control, I was on my period for six months straight. My doctor doesn't have this birth control in samples at his office. Don't know what I am going ot do about that yet. Sorry, that was so off topic, but yeah.

After I get married, I plan on having at least one kid, and then they can take it all out. It is scary being so young and have doctors on every side saying they want you to have a different surgery for different problems. Did having teh hysterctomy make things better for you? They say that te type of cysts I have should be popping with every period, but they aren't. Not in near as much pain right now! That is a major blessing, but I am so out of it, it isn't even funny.

Someone who can put it all together adn figure it all out! 2+, I have tried metformin. I am actually a diabetic. Found that out about 3 months after being told I had PCOS. They did a GTT to rule it out, and ended up showing I had it instead. Caught it early so I am able to control it easily. Are there actually different types of PCOS? I wasn't aware of that. Maybe I will talk to my GYN in August when I go back to school. Why shouldn't PCOS and stones be seen together? Is it rare when that happens? None of my doctors have mentioned anything like that. I was seeing an endocrinologist, however, I cannot afford him anymore. I have to chose between which doctors are more important, because my copay is $35, and when you are a college student working two jobs just to get by, and you go to the doctor at least once a week, it gets rather expensive. I am really trying not to even consider a hysterctomy, but every month I go through the time where it sounds so good. Do you get cramps even when you aren't on your period? I get them all month long, and have them worse while I am actually on it. I don't know how to stop them. My GYN said that the cysts wouldn't do that, but I have heard some otehrs say that bad cramps were a symptom, but I just don't know about all month long. If I were married right now, I would definitely try the whole getting pregnant cure. However, I am staying a virgin till marraige, so it isn't quite gonna work. Thank you both so much for your advice! I appreciate it so much! Also, tried the apple for nausea, and it worked! We don't have ginger, so couldn't try that. Question: Ok, well, last night when I had the morphine for the first time, like half an hour later I had these horrible pains that felt kind of like spasms in my entire abdomen. It started out with pains in like the area where my gallbladder used to be. After that, it spread to my whole abdomen. Took phenergan and reglan to help it, but it wasn't really nausea. It stayed for about 4 hours, and then I finally was able to go to sleep. Hasn't happened since then, but I make sure to eat with it now. Now the worst that happens is I get extremelt dorwsy, adn find it hard to keep my eyes open.

Maybe the palvic pain is being caused from them. I don't know, but the urologist is referring me to a pain management specialisty. He said that it may very well be adhesions from my gallbladder surgery. But would that hurt on both sides? I don't know what is causing the pain. If it isn't kidney stones, what is it? At this point I really wish that I knew. The urologist said that if he knew that taking out the kidney stones would get me out of pain, then he would do it, but he said he knew that it wouldn't work, so there was no point in taking them out at this point. He said he wants to see me in three months, so I am going in in three months for a KUB and he will see if the kidney stones have grown, and see about taking them out then if they have. I have no idea what to do or think right now. It is kinda scary all over not knowing what is causing it. Now I feel as if the doctor thinks I am just trying to find ways to get the pain meds, when I actually hate being on them, and just need them right now to keep out of pain. Sorry, I am just venting. I am just really scared, and if this is going to be something I have to live with forever (which is pretty much what the urologist said), I want to find a new way to take care of it, then just dealing with the narcotics forever.

To be honest, I don't want anymore surgery, but if they can help me and find answers, I am almost willing to do anything, rather than just sitting back and taking pain killers for the rest of my life when there is something else I could be doing. Hopefully I can find a doctor who knows something!! Thank you so much for your advice, and for just being here! I appreciate it so much. It means a lot to me.

Daisy "}, "25": {"a": "54964", "t": "Hey Allie, I am doing okay. I think that I am more depressed and scared at this point than anything. Every single doctor has a different reason for the pain, and wants me to take another approach. One thing they all (well, except one) have in common is that I should not go to the pain specialist, because he is just going to dope me up, and never get to the bottom of the pain. I am going to a chiropractor who is going to do an MRI and see if the pain is being caused by a spinal problem, stemming from an accident that I had a couple of years ago, which I have been seeing her about ever since, but she said maybe I have been aggravating it. She wants me off of the morphine. She is my moms best freind, so she hasn't been charging me for the visits. I have been in a lot of pain, but at this point I am getting used to it. I have been told that school next semester is not an option, at least away from home, due to the possiblity of surgery so coon into the semester, and with my being on final probation from my grades the past few semesters, where I have been sick for two years. So, I am having several health issues, and each doctor I talk to can't believe how much is wrong, and is like, are you sure? I am always like, I have the lab results that prove it, and some scars, wanna see. Yeah, ridiculous. Sorry, just venting. I'm scared off what is happening, mad at the world because it isn't really fair, and mad at myself for letting it get to me. At this point, I am just trying to make it everyday. Anywho...enough venting. I am glad I could make you smile. Hehe. It is amazing how much this site can help when I am going through something! I really hope that the madness of health problems can stop plaguing your family! It is horrible how much you have to go through! I am so glad that you have found the strength to carry on through it all. I have found my strength in God, though I am not afraid to admit, I am extremely weak, and constantly fall. Just hoping that He can give me the strength I need to carry on tomorrow, and forever. Daisy "}, "26": {"a": "54964", "t": "Thanks Allie, Your suggestion sounds really helpful. Last night my aunt offered to let me live with her in Tennessee, and she would help me out with stuff, and let me get to know her and stuff more. She said I could stay free, all I need to do is babysit once a month so she can get out of the house. I am thinking about doing that starting in either August or September. September would probably be better, as I could see the urologist and see if I need to have the surgery for kidney stones, unless I can talk to him and see if we could do that in August instead of September. I asked her about medical care there, and she said there is a pediatric hospital that may accept me (they accept up to the age 20, but I will be turning 21 in August), and they have all kinds of specialties, and that is 30 minutes from their house. If not, I can go to some of the several doctors in the area. She just thinks that if I stay in one office, even with several doctors, they will talk about what is going on together, and therefore make better decisions about what is going on, and seeing if anything is connected. Anyways, I am going to try and only take it at least day by day. I am making to do lists in the morning, so that I can get the things done I need to, and it won't be as overwhelming, and things don't get left off. I used to not forget things I was supposed to do. Now, it is a regular occurence. Just hoping that things will get easier. I think the hardest part about bieng in pain for me right now is not knowing what is causing the pain. It scares me not to know, because I know that there is something. Scared. What could it be?? I don't know, but hopefully the doctors will find it! Thank you so much for being here for me. I appreciate it so much. You're right, my mom is becoming more and more supportive. It used to be that she wasn't, but now she is. My dad has been really really sick since I was 10 years old, so he knows the pain. Lat night he was giving me a talk that made a lot of sense. he told me that it doesn't help to be mad at the world, or I will become a scrooge. Being mad because I am in constant pain will only get worse, because if the pain is chronic, the pain will never go away, and therefore neither will the anger. Makes perfect sense. I try not to let my feelings show, but people can tell anyways. I am glad to have supporting parents. 2 Years ago, and I wouldn't have even talked to my parents about what is going on. At that point no one in my family got along, but it seems that we have grown much much closer, which I am so thankful for, as I need them now more than ever. My mom is upset that I might move to Tenesee in a couple of months. She really wants me to stay here, but I told her it will be almost like I am away at college, but instead I will be just working. Things will work out, I do believe that, but the question is when. Thank you so much for understanding, and helpingme to deal with it. I don't know what I would do without you guys on here.

Someone mentioned trying to get into the May Clinic and seeing if they can do something for me. I don't really know anything about them, but I will research it, and see if it is a good idea.

I have to find a new endocrinologist and GYN, because both of those were at school, and since I am not going back to school next semester, I need to find one here, although I may be moving to TN in the next few months. Logistical nightmare actually. I guess my best option at this point would be to stick with it, until I have a doctor that I will be seeing regularly again, which in all honestly probably won't be until January, as I will be starting school again at that point, so moving back to the dorms. Being a student who lives in dorms, I have to move every 6 months pretty much. Really crazy. Allie, Last night was a really really really bad night. At like 10, I had some extremely sharp pain in my right side, and could not move into a spot that was comfy, especially sleeping on a couch. I took the morphine, and it did nothing. 3 hours later, I had no choice but to take it again. I was kept up all night from the pain, and by the time I fell asleep, my mom and my cousin woke up (still dark outside) and started talking, and then when they went back to bed, my dad started watching a movie. I went in to work at 8, and they told me that I have the week off, due to me going out of town last weekend, and they said they didn't know what day I was getting back, so they gave me the whole week off. I went in on Monday, and they just told me I had the day off. Oh well, he bought me breakfast, and I was still in pain anyways. At this point, I have a really bad headache from not getting snough sleep, and my side still hurts a little bitt, but not near so much as it did last night. Pretty much cried all night, and then my dad didn't understand why I was really cranky this morning. He was getting angry at me, and I just snapped, and then I have tried sleeping again, but I can't. We have family over, and there is no escape, except the computer. Not feleing sociable today. Sorry for venting. Been a really rough night, and honestly I just feel like going crazy, and no one understands, except my sister. She is the only one not angry at me at this point, because I was just really mad that I was woken up early in the morning, not very long after falling asleep, and I told my dad tha I was pretty much mad at him. Now he is not only telling me I have no right to be mad, but he is telling me that I am lazy because I was relieved I didn't have to go to work this week, and he says I need a new job where I work everyday, preferably hard labor. Just a little bit bitter about that. Trying to get along with him, but right now, I just can't take it. He was angry with me for not working today, and because I am not out putting in applications everywhere. Not that Sumter County has very many options anyways. Sorry, another rant. At least I have until Sunday off. Maybe I can get some rest, and hopefully no more attacks like last night will happen. Not only was it my side, but where my gallbladder used to be, but it was like two distinct pains going on at the same time. Not sure what is going on, but I have absolutely no money to go to a doctor right now, and the pain is calming itself right now. I just don't plan on moving around much today. Thanks for listening!

I did tell them about the PCOS. They told me that when I get there, I will be given a complete physical, and they will go over everything, such as my medical history, and also my family history. Sad that I don't know much of my family history. I should talk to my parents about it, but I don't know how to talk to my parents about it. They make me feel as if I am just going to the doctor for attention. They say I have answers, why should I keep pressing. I was like, ummm...so morphine is now an answer? Sorry...didn't mean to get off on that. Just frustrated right now. Really tired, and cannot get back to sleep, so in order to get away from noise I got on the computer. So, I have figured out that a month is a long time to wait to go to the doctor. I am hating the wait, but at this point, I still won't have enough money to make the trip then, with all the time off I have, so I guess it is necessary torture. At least I am going, instead of just sitting home and not doing anything but going to painmanagement (which I have decided that it might help to try in the meantime?) . I will go next week, and if all they say is to go on more pain killers, I will just scream, and then leave. No, not really, but in my mind that is what I will be doing. Hehe. So, any clue what could have caused that pain last night? The one that got me was the chest pain when I breathed in, right where my gallbladder used to be, up my ribs. It was really weird. No idea what is causing the side/back pain either, but I am \"getting used to it\" (if that is what you call it). I am really hoping that by the time summer is over, the doctors will at least know what is wrong.

So, I asked a waitress, and then my boss took me to the back, and was like, where the **** do you think the togo order is? At the salad bar? In the bathroom? He said that if I had to ask such a stupid question, I shouldn't ask it in front of customers who will think that nobody there knows what they are doing. I couldn't help it. I went to the back room, and cried. I didn't mean to, but me not feeling good, I was way more emotional than usual. I am used to being called stupid, so normally I don't let it phase me, but tonight I was just not in the kind of mood to be talked like that to. Even after I thought I was done, I was taking someone elses money, and realized tears were still flowing. My boss must really have loved that...not. He got mad that I was crying. I didn't tell him why I was crying. I just went on about my business. Right now, I am just really emotional...more than normal. Everything has become just to much to handle on my own, and it feels like I have to carry everything by myself. No one at home understands. Uggh...I am so frustrated. Luckily at work, I didn't pass out, although I did come pretty close a couple of times when lifting stuff. I really hope that I will feel better by tomorrow morning, as I have to work at 9. Don't really wanna go. Don't want to feel stupid again. The nerve of him. And I wasn't the only one who he said was stupid. There was a waitress who ws hired after me that didn't know we had kid menus, and he pretty much bashed her to. We were both so frustrated all night. Oh well. Well, I am going to try and get some rest before going to bed. Good night. Daisy "}, "53": {"a": "54964", "t": "Hey Allie, Thank you so much! Actually, my family called me stupid for several years before I went to college, and then started again this summer. I tend to let it just roll now. I would love to get 2+'s skillet. Hey, I work in a restaurant. Maybe it would hurt more if I used one fo his own. Hehe. Oh my gosh, I wanted to jsut seriously quit, and probably would have, had I not needed the money so desperately. Trying to pay for Mayo is not easy. I appreciate your caring so much. It is so easy just to get frustrated and hold it all in. Maybe that is why tonight was so bad, I have been holding in so much for so long, taht that was all it took to get me. I like the idea of having a good time to cry! Much needed. With the lightheadedness, I don't really eat all that often, although I do need to as I am a diabetic. My sugar has been normal today though. I can't afford food at the restaurant, as I am saving up all of the money I make (or try to anyways). My mom thinks that it is allergies and sinuses. Instead of going to sleep, my mom just got home, and she saw me crying so we went to her room and talked. She told me to quit my job, but then agrees that if I do, I can't go to Mayo (as she won't pay). She says I am old enough to pay my own way. Anywho...that's not the point. Me and my mom actually talked tonight, and that was good. Since I haven't eatten much today, and my brother wanted McDs, she is getting em something to eat. Maybe after that I will feel better. I hope I can sleep tonight. Oh, and yes, I am slightly anemic according to my last lab work. The doctor said it was nothing to be concerned with (although my mom did inform me afterwards that as a child I was constantly anemic, which I had no idea about. Apparently it worked itself out by the tiem I was in like 4th or 5th grade. Since the lab work was like a month ago, do you think it could have gotten worse? I don't really know. My mom told me that I should put myself on a gluten free diet, and see if my health starts to improve. Maybe that is a good idea. She says maybe I have Celiac or something. I don't know. She was talking about it as we were laying there talking about my boss being a jerk. And to think...my sister (who doesn't work there) is still up there visiting with him even though te place closed up like 2 and a half hours ago. Grrr. Ok, well, I am hoping that this migraine will just go away really soon. It is just making me very grouchy and emotional. Thank you so much for caring! You are so amazing. I appreciate you so much. Even though you go through a ton, you still take time out to care for everyone else. You trully are an angel!! Thank you so much!! Daisy "}, "54": {"a": "54964", "t": "Thank you so much for your kind words and your encuoragement Linda. I appreciate it so much. Actually, the boss that said it is the owner ofthe restaurant, so there is really no one higher to go to, but he did apologize this morning. My sister went to the restaurant before I got on and had a chat with him. I love her. Sorry to hear about all that your niece went though. It is horrible to be in so much pain and not have people believe you. But for you, there was really no way to know. I don't really blame anyone for not believing me. I am sure that she understands as well. My dad has pancreatitis as well, and he is always getting pain from it. They have never done surgery for his. I really hope that at the Mayo Clinic, they will be able to figure out what was wrong. I have to drive about 4 hours to get there. If I can't come up with the money, my parents won't help. I wish they would. They said that I had to be responsible for it. I am kind upset about it. Luckily I have an amazing youth leader who said that this chance to go to Mayo would be the best opportunity I have ever had, and that money shouldn't stop me, so if I am short she will work out a deal with me. I really don't want to have to ask her for a ton of money though, as she doesn't have much either. She is amazing enough just taking time out to come up there and stay with me through all of it, as my family is going on vacation. If they decide to do surgery I don't know what is going ot happen. At least my youth leader will be there. My family is going to TN. I have to work and go to Mayo, so I couldn't go. Oh well. I hope that you can start to feel better as well. And I really hope that they will figure out what is wrong with you. I know what it is like to not know. It is pretty scary. Being sick is never fun. Thank you so much for your kind words! I really appreciate it. Hope everything works out for you!! Hugs, Daisy PS- Thanks for being here for me. "}, "55": {"a": "54964", "t": "Anyone know what I can take to get rid of this migraine?

I also have to pay for food while I am there and gas there and back. Not going to be cheap for all that. Wouldn't be bad if I was making decent money, but working only three days a week at minimum wage makes it difficult. I am feeling somewhat better right now. Thanks for asking.

Yesterday they sent me home at 12:30. I can ask the pastor about it. Right now they are doing tons of fundraisers to build a church building (it is a church plant, so we have never had our own building, and they are tryingto raise the money for it). I think the pastor will understand. I am going to his house tonight for Bible study. I just don't want my mom to know I am asking, because she will be hopping mad. She makes it out to everyone else that she is oh so willing to help, but then when we get home, it is a whole different story. Oh well. Well, I am off to get a little more sleep before work.

It is working a little bit right now, but boy has it been rough. I will talk to him tonight. My mom will be there to, so i don't know how that will work. I can't really drive myself, so if she doesn't go, neither do I really. Ok, well I need to go and lay down. I will check up on everyone in a little bit. I can't sit here any longer.

My dad took off with my car, and got upset when I told him that I needed the car back by 2 (which is in three hours), and he told me that I need to keep my sisters car (who has to go to work). Oh well. At least he is bringing my car back so I can go. 2+, that is a great idea. Thank you very much. I will do that. It will have to be next Sunday night, but hopefully my mom will not get upset. Thanks for the advice!! I am going to go back and lay down for a bit. See if the rest of this headache goes away. I think the HeadOn is starting to work. It says oin the package to use it at the start of a headache, andI was using it after it had done settled in to stay. I think it was setting up house in there for real. Every little brain cell was some different room in the house. Hehe. Well, I told it rent ws due, and well, most of them can't pay. The others can't either, but they stubborn little snots. Hehe.

He told me to take all three pills at the same time. I don't think that taking Morphine and a sleep aid will be very good. He was going to give me a shot of Phenergan, but when I told him I had taken some last night, it didn't do anything but help the nausea, he decided against it. Apparently it works for some headaches. He wants to see me in another month. He only gave me two headache pills and two sleep pills, so I hope that it helps. If not, he said to come back. Let's just say, it had better. I am going crazy. He also told me that my pressure in m ear was coming from a blockage in the ear, where you normally cant reach with anything to clean, so they flushed it. I cried, it hurt so bad. It feels better though. Now, I am off to bed, and to see if I can get a good nights sleep. Don't know what time I will wake up, hopefully tomorrow sometime. I will get back then.

I went to bed around 1, and here I am back up at 7, still having a migraine. Going to try laying down for the rest of hte day, see if that works. The doctor told me to come back if it didn't work. Maybe I will call and see if I can talk directly to him. This is getting to be horrible. At least the pressure is gone, because they flushed my ear. The doctor said that my ear wasn't causing it. I don't know what is, but I am going to kick the living snot out of. Hehe...not really. Well, I am going to go ahead and get off of here, but thank you both for commenting. You guys are both sweet.

I tend to threaten to beat people with sticks (one of my favorite sayings actually), but I think it would mean more if I say I am going to have f friend beat tehm with a skillet. Hehe. Yeah, I am feeling much better right now. Not as sick to my stomach (I had to take more stomach medicine for that), and my headache is finally gone (I hope for good this time, since it doesn't even feel like there is much pressure).

Agrivating though, thats for sure. But, at least I am off work until Friday. I have even made plans to get out of the house this week.

I called the doctor today, and he told me that he is pretty much stuck with options he can give me, because of my multitude of medications. He finally decided that I should get off of the Tylenol 4 for a little bit so i could try another medication that has Tylenol in it, and hopefully it will work. He said if it doesn't, he is out of options. Well, isn't that just peachy? Oh, I called my pain management specialist to get the results of my Xray, and he said that it looks fine, so he definitely thinks it is the kidney stones causing the pain.

Has aspirin, codiene, caffeine, and something that starts with a b. The urologist said that litho wasn't an option for me. I don't know exactly why. He said he will go in through the back. But I will ask him again tomorrow about it. I just want these stupid things out. The recovery can't be near so bad as having these bad boys in here. My youth pastor is going to Mayo with me.

Well, my doctor told me that he can't remember talking to me about possible surgery, but he agreed to see me next week, due to the amount of pain (no way I was really gonna wait for a couple of months before getting this crap taken care of), so I got the KUB done today, and I go to the urologist on Monday. If he tells me I can have surgery (which I really hope that he does, because I want rid of these blasted things), I will schedule it for the week after I get back from Mayo, as next week is teh week before, so it wouldn't give me enough time to recover, unless I do get litho, which apparently he can't remember telling me I can't have. I am so blasted confused. Oh well. At least it is getting taken care of for real. Now I have a copuple of hours before going ot a mandatory meeting for my job. Oh, and guess what. My sister (who I don't get along with at all) got a job there last night, and she already has anotehr one, where she gets a ton of hours, but on her days off, she is working with me. watch her get more hours. I am a little bitter, but oh well. Last time we had a job together it didn't really work out to well. But luckily she is working at her otehr job the days that I go to work, so hopefully we don't have to work at teh same time. Sorry to complain about that, I am just a little upset. Today is going okay. I just really want all the pain to go away. The migraine is pretty much gone. It is there a tiny bit, but that is fine. Not excrutiating anymore!! That is pretty much all that counts. Hope you all are doing well!! Thanks for your love and support. It trully helps! Daisy "}, "88": {"a": "54964", "t": "It has been an okay last couple of days. the headache is barely there, but the pain in my sides is pretty bad. Not being around home much helped though. In exactly two weeks I go to the Mayo Clinic. My chiropractor is mad at me for making an appointment to see the urologist on Monday. She said that he is goingto give me two options, eitehr change my medication, or set a date for surgery. She said I only have two weeks left before Mayo, and I should wait until after that to go back there. She is also mad that the headache medicine they gave me has a narcotic in it. All she said was that I was going to get addicted. I know she was justupset because she cares, but still. I want to be out of pain as soon as possible. She was like, you have been in pain for months now, why can't you wait two more weeks. First of all, who wants to wait that long?? Not me!! But maybe I am just being whimpy. My thoughts are, I can go next week to set up a date for surgery, and make it for right after I get back from Mayo. If after Mayo, I decide it isn't necessary, then I can decide not to do it. But, there really is no sense to wait for forever to do it. Especially if I am in pain. Sorry, I don't mean to get all upset about it, but I just don't understand. I really don't like having to deal with everything. It is ridiculous! Hope all of you are doing well! BTW, getting out of the house for a couple of days was good.

I have been looking to check up on, you but can't find it. Hope that you are feeling ok. It is almost the weekend!! Yay! I hope that your boss has a good experience at Mayo. I just can't wait to get everything figured out. Time sure does go by fast, doesn't it? I seriously can't believe it is already July! I am that much closer to an answer finally. I am hoping that when I get it, the surgery will help with the pain. At least I know that it will prevent further pain if not, as I won't have to pass the stones late on. Two more weeks. Yay!!

My boss told me today that he is cutting my hours due to my health situation. He says that he realized last night how bad it is. I had a problem with my sugar (I have lost my appetite lately, and last night I hadn't eatten all day, and so my sugar dropped, but nothing bad happened, and I had it under control pretty fast). I was in pain then as well. They called me this morning and told me that they were dead, so not to come in. I am never going ot have enough money to pay for Mayo. Definitely talking to the pastor tomorrow. I am so worried about it. But, I am not working at my job that much longer anyways. As soon as the kidney stones are taken care of, I am going to be leaving for TN for a few months. I can't wait. That is going ot be amazing!!! Anywho...going to go back to lay down. Have a goodnight!

I asked the pastor's wife today about it, and she didn't give me an answer yet. I will call her tomorrow to find out. Today was a really, really rough day! I was in a ton of pain, and last night I could only sleep for 2 hours, as I was in a ton of pain. My back hurts, as well as having pelvic pain, and I have been on my period for 2 weeks now. On the drive home from work I pretty much wanted to give up on everything, and there was only one thing that kept me from doing something really stupid. Depression is hitting me really bad. I am going to talk to my doctor about it on Wednesday. My pastor's wife did give me a lot of encouragement and advice, and made me promise that I would call someone if something happened again. She gave me the numbers to a couple of different places. She also talked with the youth pastor who is going to Mayo with me. The youth pastor hasn't said anything yet to me, but I am sure she will later on. Sorry, don't mean to go on and on. I just have no one at home to talk to. Can't wait to get teh surgery out of the way, so that I can get to TN to haev some support from family. I am glad taht my church is standing behind me though, and willing to help out. Hope that everyone is having a good day. I won't be on tomorrow, as I will be in New Port Richey, and away from a computer. Will be back on Tuesday night to report the doctor's findings. Maybe in the afternoon, as I plan on stopping by my college campus for a little bit to catch up with the dean. Then I am going to another doctor on Wednesday. Fun fun. "}, "95": {"a": "54964", "t": "Thank you so much!! I am feeling a little bit better right now. Having a couple of issues, but whatever. I went to the urologist yesterday, and the GYN. The urologist told me that he doesn't think the kidney stones are causing the pain. He said I do have quite a few small ones, but they are all in the kidneys still, and not obstructing anything. He said he would take them all out though, to prove the pain management specialist wrong. I am so frustrated. He said he will be doing the surgery two times, one for each side. However, he did say he would do the ureteroscopy, cystoscopy, holmium laser, and JJ stent. I am getting the right side taken care of on August 2nd. The left side will be on August 9th. My birthday is on the 8th. Happy birthday to me. Hehe. I don't know what I am going to do if the pain really isn't being caused by the stones. I am thinking of it this way: if he gets rid of the stones, at least I won't have to go through the pain of passing them, whether they are causing pain now or not. I am just so frustrated at this point. My GYN put me on a different birth control. Now, tomorrow morning I am going to my GP for a follow up on the migraines. So much fun. Only a week and like 2 days befroe Mayo. Nervous, but can't wait until they figure it all out. Just hoping for good results. It was nice being able to see some of my friends from school. We all laughed and cried while I was there. I miss them so much, and am upset about not going back next semester, but we all believe that it is the right decision. Hope everyone has a great night!! I am exhausted, as a lot has happened in the past couple of days. Blew a tire in New Port Richey. Fun stuff there. Been driving over 700 milles in two days. So ready to get to sleep. Don't know how much sleep I am going to get, but hopefully enough to get through the appointment tomorrow, but after that, I am done, and can take a nap. Good night!!

I am tired of living like this. My hope is that the surgery would work, even though the uro says it won't. I don't know what to think! I went to my GP today, and he said he was staying out of it. But, he did do research on my issues with migraines, and nausea, and depression, and he gave me anotehr antidepressant to start, and it is less than 3 dollars a month. He said it should help all three, but if not, then he wants either a CT scan or MRI on my head, to see if there is anotehr cause. He said that I shouldn't be having them this severe, nor this often, but he hopes the new medication will work. He said for about a week, it will make everything worse, but then it will get better. I don't like that I will feel worse, but look forward to not being depressed, and also getting rid of the other problems. Hopefully Mayo will be able to help with everything. Start treating what is wrong, rather than just the symptoms all of the time. Being on all of this medication can't be healthy. Thanks for your concern. I am so scared, it isn't even funny. I just want to know what is wrong, and have it fixed. For right now, I think I am going ot take a nap (I didn't get very much sleep last night) and take my mind off of things. Hopefully the nap will help. Haven't taken a nap in two or three days, but still not doing so hot with sleeping. One week till Mayo!!!

I took it at like 9 or 10 last inght, was out within 2 hours, and slept until 10:30 this morning!! That was amazing, for real. I feel really well rested for the first time in forever. My insurance company has something called health dialog, where you can call them if you are having a problem, and speack to a health coach, who is an RN. Well, I have a permanent health coach, and she is amazing. We started talking when I first started getting kidney stones, and then again when I got the migraine that lasted for a while. She called me back last night to see if it had gone away, and when I told her it just keeps coming back, she was doing research on it, and giving me tips on getting rid of the pain and the migraine and such. After we hung up, after talking for like an hour or two, it wasn't but maybe 20 minjutes later she calls back and says that she was still looking up what it could be, and found something called parathyroid disease, which makes you depressed all the time, gives you kidney stones, gives you recurrent headaches, makes you have chronic fatigue, and loss of appetite and everything. I am going to ask about that at Mayo next week. Hopefully they will be able to figure it out. If that is what I have, then after having it removed, the lady told me that the symptoms would go away usually within like 2-3 weeks, if it takes that long! I totally hope that that is it, because then that would end a lot of things. I have looked at my lab work, and it showed that my calcium has been up and down for a while, sometimes high, sometimes on the upper levels of normal. The nurse told me that when they are high, it is pretty much a sure thing that it is your parathyroid. My doctors office just called as I was writing, and has ordered the test for my whole thyroid, and the parathyroid and such. Doing hte labs in the morning, so hopefully they will know what is up by early next week. Then I can take the lab results to Mayo for a secnod opinion as well. Hopeing all goes well.

I had talked to two or three others, and they would help me through the crisis of the moment (usually telling me to go to ER), but this lady gave me her extension number, and talked to me about everything she could think of that might be wrong.

I honestly feel like I can't move anymore. My sister was tehre helping out the waitress, and was worried about me all night.

I don't know what it is, but it sure felt miserable. he cut my hours, because he said I couldn't handle that kind of stuff, and then he makes me do all taht, instead of bussing tables?

I think it is being caused by my new medication. I called the nurse at my doctors office, and she called an ambulance for me, as I was home alone. Went to ER, and stayed there a few hours hooked to an IV, and like every 15 minutes they checked to see how my blood pressure was doing, laying, sitting and standing. I was extremely dehydrated, and my blood pressure was really low. They told me to make sure that I am really careful changing positions, as that is what prompted me to call the doctor in the first place, was me standing up, and waking up with my dog licking my face. Not pleasant at all. I just hope that it is my medication causing it. My sugar was also low, so I had quite a few problems taht could have caused it, but I had just eatten, and they kept checking my sugar (the firemen came before the paramedics) until the ambulance was there, and it never really went up. They had me sucking on this nasty glucose gel too. I am SO glad that that was over with. My youth pastor came and picked me up from teh hospital. When they told me I had to call my family, my mom was freaking out, and telling my dad that they were coming home right then. But I told them not to worry about it, that it would be fine. I feel better now. Still lightheaded, but doing better. As I was leaving though, theh nurse who walked me out wanted me to go back in, because as soon as I started walking, I started getting pale again. I told her I would be fine, so they let me just continue on my way. I just hope it doesn't happen again. Didn't sleep last night hardly at all. Was really mad about that. Oh well, got to sleep in the hospital bed. They get you in much quicker when you come in by amulance! Although, I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes really to get called in, but for a doctor to treat me took forever. This way, teh doctor was right on it. Had an EKG, and they took blood, and then they did they IV fluids. After the IV was out, they let me go. They just told me to be extremely careful in staying hydrated, and changing positions. So, I have decided no more trips to ER for me. This is the 4th one since December. That means 4 to many. Hehe.

I also will need to have an oxometer test, where they test your oxygen while you sleep. He said that it definitely isn't the kidney stones giving me problems, so he wants me not to have teh surgeries. He said that seeing an acupuncturist at home would be a good plan as well. He did an xray of my whole spine yesterday, and today I had labwork (tons!!) , and three ultrasounds. The whole ride home I had to go to the bathroom every 10-15 minutes (and it is a four hour drive anyways) because they had me drink 8 glasses of water before the second one.

Well, I had to leave early, because it just got too bad, and everyone could see it. I called my health coach, who told me to call my doctor at Mayo. He told me that I should go directly to ER, as I had waited about 6 hours, and my pulse was still 130, laying down for an hour. I told my mom, but she just shrugged it off, and went to sleep. So, back to bed i go, but feeling really yucky. Then my mom comes in about an hour later, and lays down on my bed (I was laying on my sisters bed, as I needed my cell phone to be near me, and it had to charge), and she watches me for about 30 minutes, and then she goes back to bed, knowing I didn't feel any better. I guess somehow I finally fell asleep, but I am still not feeling so great. My head is pounding, but it isn't as dizzy as it was last night. I thought I was done with my cold, but this morning I kept coughing up brown phlegm (sorry to be gross). No other cold symptoms, but I am taking the phlegm to be not a healthy sign. I forgot that we have an urgent care right up the road (although it is only open like normal doctor hours, so it wouldn't have mattered last night anyways), so I think I will go there this morning. But, should I have my parents drive me? My mom will probably be mad that I am even considering going. I don't know. If they aren't up in 15 minutes, I am just going to go. Not leave a note, so if they ask me when I get back, I might think of an excuse, unless they tell me that I need to go to ER, if they do, I will go home, and tell my dad. I am flipping sore too. Don't know what to do about that. Don't want to take the Tylenol 4, as I have no idea what is causing the stuff going on with my head. Uggh...What to do, what to do. I am hurting so bad. Okay, well I am going to go and get dressed, so that I can go to the doctor. Good thing I got paid yesterday (the measly $115 for two weeks, yeah, and my parents wonder why I need help), because I already owe this place a good $200, and they refuse to see me if I don't pay anymore. OK, well, I am off. I decided better not wait 15 minutes. they are only open until 12 today, so I had better get in early, as the line fills up pretty fast. Will update when I get home. Bye. Hope your nights were better!! Sorry to complain, I just had a bad night, and want to cry and get it over with, but that just makes the headache worse. Arrgh... "}, "115": {"a": "54964", "t": "Went to doctor. My mom called while I was waiting on the doctor to walk in. I told her I was at the store, because she was SO mad that I wasn't home. Then I went to the store to make it true. She would have been even more mad had I told her I went to the doctor without her knowing, but even if she had known she would be mad. I know her. She wasn't so happy last night with me. Oh well. The doctor said that it was most likely vertigo caused by the infection or cold or whatever went down into my inner ear. He said that hopefully it won't come back as bad as it was yesterday, but wrote a prescription for me just in case. He told me not to take Phenergan, Elavil, Tylenol 4, or Fiorinal for at least a week in order to make sure that it doesn't come back. He also told me not to put my head in the same position as when this whole mess first started, or it would trigger it again. I don't even know what position it was in. I was leaning forward a tiny bit to close the ac vent. I don't even know. But, going to try not to do it again, that is for sure!! He told me it was nothing to worry about, just make sure I don't get it so bad that I start to throw up and stuff. So yeah, that's about it. "}, "116": {"a": "54964", "t": "Thanks for the advice! Yeah, we do need to talk a lot. There is so much tension in the air between us it isn't even funny. But it is so hard to talk to her about it. We both just ahve different points of view, and neither are necessarily wrong, just different. Yeah, so today I find out that I am pretty anemic. The Mayo Clinic doctor called and told me that it couldn't wait until I came back, that I had to see my PCP. Well, did that, and that guy is just plain retarded. Can we give him an Idiot Award? He tells me that it is nothing to worry about, probably just being caused by my period, which by the way, I haven't had in two months, so that isn't it. Then he says, well, if you want to take care of that, might as well take something for your cholesterol as well. So, he writes me a prescription, then tells me that my cholesterol was good for someone without diabetes, but with diabetes, it was only 1 point off. Umm...then he tells me that he will check my liver function once a month, because chances are high that it will stop functioning while I am on it. I was like, can't I fix it with medication. He was like, well, you can, but if you are so many medications now, what does it matter to add another one instead of changing your diet? Umm...yeah, because I might want to keep my liver!! So far so good with that one buddy, let's keep it that way! But, being anemic explains a lot of things, so I am hoping that taking the iron helps with that. As for the cholesterol medication, the doctors at Mayo weren't too concerned about that, or they would have mentioned it when they called, so I am not to concerned. This doctor I went to today is the same one who told me that when I had a migraine, take Frova, Morphine, and a sleeping pill at the same time, and two hours later, if I am still awake, take it all over again. Yeah, not so trusting this guy, but he is the best one in Sumter County. Hmmm...what to do? No idea! MOVE!! Anywho...so far no more dizziness. The pulse is still high. It was again in the 120s when I went to the doctor today. I am getting used to that by now. Just glad the vertigo is gone!! My mom didn't blow up at me when I got home, as I told her I went to the store, and she didn't know I went to the doctor. I told her about today's appointment. So, apparently being anemic runs in the family. Who knew? Not me. Would have been kinda nice to know. Oh well. So, taht's my life. Craziness...and what is up with getting all the health problems thrown in there? I don't need anything to add to teh list, thank you. Hehe. "}, "117": {"a": "54964", "t": "Thanks 2 +. Found the post you were talking about. It does sound similar, so I am going to research it a bit and see about it. Will probably have to wait to go to Mayo again to check into it. This doctor here at home isn't all that great if you ask me. Thanks!! "}, "118": {"a": "54964", "t": "Hello! Well, not having a very good day. Yesterday I got a phone call from my health coach, and my doctor, both telling me that I should take absolutely no pain meds, not even tylenol or aspirin, or something. So, I now have a migraine, and my back is KILLING me. But, they did suggest trying to lay on my stomach, arch it back (which for some weird reason actually helps dull the pain a little bit) and try taking deep breaths directly to the spot where it hurts. I have to breathe out slowly, because breathing hurts like the devil when I exhale. Breathing in does make it feel better. But the doctor is now unsure of wheter it is my kidney, as the pain last night was right over the right kidney. It was so bad. And today I got called in to work. Oh, and there is some major issues going on at home. I have found out why my parents aren't supporting me emotionally or anything. Yeah, my mom is very much on the brink of suicide. She has been drinking for a couple of weeks, and now she is cutting. Las tnight my dad was talking about checking her into lifestreams. The counselor she sees doubled her medication yesterday, but that won't kick in for a few days at least. She starts teaching next week. I am so worried about her now. So, that was how my birthday has been, but I am going to be going to church in a couple of minutes. I have been talking to the pastor's wife about myself, and about my mom, so hopefully we can get her some help, and now that I have someone I can trust, I am actually doing much better. the last two weeks people at work have been commenting on how much happier I am, so yay. My dad is talking about bakeracting my mom. Don't know how I can help. So aggravated with things today, but I will be fine. I will update more later. Oh, and any way of getting out of pain naturally would be amazing. Anything that doesn't include pills, because well, those just sren't an option they said. Grrr. I wonder what the labs showed from Mayo, if they were worse than the otehrs. Well, ok. TTYL! Daisy "}, "119": {"a": "54964", "t": "Bakeracting is committing her to a place that will help her because she is extremely suicidal. If she wouldn't have gone semi-voluntarily last night my dad would have went and told the authorities or someone to pick her up. You need two adults to tell them that she is a danger to herself if you are going to do that. But, last night she and my dad went and she is staying there, hopefully for at least a couple of days. If she gets out, my family feels that it will just get worse. Yeah, I know that God has a purpose for everything, so I am just trying to find all of the blessings and write them down in a journal so that I can remember what He has done for me, and I even thank Him for the hard times, because somehow they will influence who I am going to be, and what His will for the rest of my life is. I was cutting a few months ago, to try and get rid of the rest of the pain, and to actually be able to control something going on. No one ever knew, because I did it on my stomach, so that no one would be able to figure it out, because that is always covered up. I quit once I started talking to my pastor's wife about the depression. Apparently everyone at church has seen a big difference in everything about me. I am much more like the bubbly person I used to be, and I am always giggling again. I stopped secluding myself. Thanks for your encouragement. Journalling is one thing that I have found helps me as well. I am so glad that you found something that helped you. And I am glad that you had good friends! That helps a lot!! Hehe...I don't even know how I wanted to celebrate it...hmmm...well, we are going to meet my mom's sister in Orlando today. My mom said she still wanted us to go and hang out with them even though she won't be there, and they still want to see us, so I think it will be good to get out. I am doing a littl ebit better painwise. Just hoping there is not much walking today. Don't know how much of that I can handle without breaking down and crying. Spent all last night crying, part out of emotions, part out of the pain, which gets so much worse at night. I am still trying to figure out ways to alleviate the pain without pain meds. I think that if it is still bad tonight, I might break down and take something anyways. Tired of the pain. Can't handle it anymore. Thanks for listening! It helps a lot.

As for SIL and BIL I just amuze myself with their ignorence so I find it quit funny to hear them talk sometimes.Oh well they arent that bad if you just learn to hear only half of what they say..........lol.Dont know when we will be able to get away might not be for a few weeks.We have a lot to do around the house like paint and some minor changes I want to do.I am planning on taking another cycle off then doing 1 more IUI then IVF if it doesnt work.I wont hold my breath but I figure 1 more IUI.So I will maybe do a cycle in December but who knows I might wait till after the holidays dont know if I want to cycle during the holidays.

You should not have to put up with sub-standard behaviour like that and if I were you I would be laying an official complaint.

No, I am sorry, it just isn't good enough. I don't want to fuel your fire but it makes me sick to my stomach to see you treated this way. Please know I am thinking of you and can completely feel your disappointment. When you finally get to see the doctor I am certain that your problem will be easily fixed.

Sounds like you had quite the weekend. And stories like the one you shared really move me to tears as well. I don't understand the reasoning behind so many things in our bizarre world, and I sure don't know why all of us are challenged with IF.

Your doctor should be able to answer those questions if the others can not. Good luck hun. I can't wait to hear how everything goes! Glad to hear your day is going so well.... I am having a fine day myself. I'm still anxiously awaiting the call from my NP. Even though I expect her to reaffirm that I am not pregnant, I'm excited to hear more about the frozen transfer.

Sometimes they just don't get it...and they dont' handle their emotions like we do. And I know we're not a replacement for DH, but please remember that is why we are here.

It's very frustrating I can't decorate that room in our house (I refuse to decorate without a BFP!!!) . I'm so excited for your surgery and to see the outcome. I'm hoping it's the key to your BFP.

I had to wait till my next doctor appointment to find out how it came out. Here at the RE office there is an u/s machine in each room, most of the appointments I get one and I can see the monitor. After 10 of them I started to dig what those spots mean, until then it was all a bag of potatoes to me . It's a little uncomfortable, mostly the first one you have, but its no real pain. Oh, and I get mine with an empty bladder. And the left ovary might be shy sometimes because its hiding from the bowel, nothing wrong, more fiber will help with that. When are the blood results in? Are they gonna let you know as soon as they get them in or you have to get appointment? My RE office calls me and tells me over the phone the levels.

I need to speak to them, because I had meningitis once (I was 10) , and my gyn think that is worth talking over with Dr.Sleeping. November 8th is my pre-op appointment with my gyn, he will get me to sign the necessary papers and answer any questions that I have. And November 14th is the actual surgery!!

(of course) I asked the nurse, is it normal for me to be cramping andpassing clots when I have polyp (I passed another one about anhour ago) and she said that she can't answer that. And I asked why? And she said because they are not legally allowed to answer medical questions over the phone. So Isaid, Okay, pretend I'm in high school and I'm asking you for a science project on the female reprodictive system. And she said, she stil can't answer. So now I guess I'm off to search if that is normal or something I shoudl be concerned about. If it was something to be concerened about, she would have told me, right?

Basically, (some things getting lost in translation between the french and english ) he feels helpless when he sees me upset. And I get upset very easily....especially since it seems like every news program has at least one story about a child being kidnapped, abused, tortured, killed, soemthing. It's sad and bothersome to the whole world to hear of chldren this way, but I think, in my opinion, it's harder for us IF sisters to hear about . No? Forgive, I get distracted Anyway, basically, all he feels is \"What can I do to make it better?\" and as it is right now, he can't really do anyhting. I mean, I told him that maybe sometimes, he could just listen to me without having to say anything, because sometimes I just need to vent to him and lean on him. He said he'd be okay with that, since it means that he wouldn't have to say anythiing, because he is scared that he won't say the right thing and I'll just be even more upset. But, of course, I won't vent to him all the time----only when I really feel like it, because I knwo that he isn't wholly comfortable with the upset wife talking abotu feelings. I feel much better this week.....after that talk we really decided we're going to go full-steam ahead withthe baby making. As soon as the procedure is over, of course. Come on, November 14th!!!!! By the way, when i got home, he had pink roses (my favourites) delviered with an apology for his words, because no matter how he was feeling, they really were inappropriate.

How many days have you been taking synthroid? Do you have Hashimoto's thyroiditis? Did your MD test for it? An increase in joint pain and muscle aches can happen as a result of long starved portions of your body coming back on line with the addition of needed thyroid hormone. However low vit D, ferritin, magnesium, potassium, and vit B12 can also have similar side effects. These issues can be aggravated as newly added thyroid hormone increases your body's demand for key nutrients and vitamins. SO if you haven't had your: vit D, B12, Ferritin, Magnesium and potassium tested recently you should get them done. Also if your MD failed to test you for Hashimoto's you need to get him to request the following lab coded tests TPOAb and TGAb. Also if your MD has not tested your Ft4 and FT3, He needs a V8 head slap and should run them as well. In the mean time you should be MD shopping with someone a little more up to date and thorough in thyroid care and management. When did your MD want you to come back in for a level recheck.

MG "}, "1": {"a": "4333", "t": "If you are hypothyroid and have positive antibodies then you are talking Hashimoto's thyroiditis. If you started on 25 mcgs of thyroxine then you most likely will have a drop in levels. Many people when initially starting thyroid meds begin to feel worse their second week, becaue their thyroid has reduced its T4 production resulting in an increased thyroid hormone deficite. In others the bodymetabolism begins to wake up deprived systems and the overall T4/T3 demand in your system increases. Six weeks from the on set of medicine is reasonable, but if you have excessive hypothyroid symptoms call and see if you can get a blood work draw scheduled at 4 weeks. It takes time for Free Thyroxine (FT4) and Free Triiodothyronine (FT3) to be processed in the labs. Normal is often not optimal. If you get the copy of your labs and ranges I can tell you where you are in range and statistically where you should be according to current studies. It is hard for some one that isn't hypothyroid or hyperthyroid to understand how such a small pain in the neck gland can cause SOOOO MMUUUCCCHHHH trouble. Most MDs take it lightly because their bedside manner needs work, others don't care and you are just one more cow to brand and hustle down the shute. It is the rare MD that takes the time to listen, evaluate your symptoms and blood work, AND actually dig about til the find and treat the source of your issues. Like any industry, the MEDICAL industry has good manufacturer's and poor ones. You also do not always get what you pay for. I am sorry you are going through this. It will get better.

You are definitly suboptimal in T3 and Ft4 levels in my opinion. Your TSH indicates hypothyroid with out doubt. Your thyroid antibodies normally have a limit around 30. Anything above that limit indicates Hashimoto's. The higher the level the more aggressive or active your Hashimoto's is... make sense? MG "}, "3": {"a": "4333", "t": "Niksi, Glad I could help. You can also supplement your diet and minerals to get some relief. I know how hard it is to get adequate and timely thyroid care and support through the NHS. You should see if you can get a few essential baseline blood tests for hypoTs. Your GP should be able to run them for you if fatigue and tiredness are in your current symptom set. HypoTs tend to suffer from malabsorption issues which aggravate hypoT symptoms: low ferritin, low vit. D, low magnesium, and/or low B12 can cause a wide combination of hypoT symptoms. It is important to know if you need to take extra supplementation to aide in this regard. Another supplement that can affect us is Selenium. You do not want too much, but it is helpful in T4 to t3 conversion and lowering Hashimoto's antibodies to make sure you are taking a multivitamin that has the 100&#37; recommended dosage of Selenium in it. Any more and you could be risking toxicity issues. Also see if your multivitamin has iodine in it. you may be iodine deficient. In some adding iodine makes this worse, in others it helps.

This takes up a lot of T4 and may not allow it to be used appropriately. High estrogen, DHEA, estrogen are signs of PCOS and insulin resistance. Since you have a family history of estrogen dominance you should get your adrenal function tested to make sure you are not following the same path. I just found out I have PCOS/insulin resistance and am reactive hypoglycemic. This seems to be common in hypoTs and can make getting back to your old self more of a challenge if not treated properly.

It is not always pretty. Adrenal issues can be picked up in your Ft4 and Ft3 ratios. If your actual T4 and T3 levels are not in balance it points to a conversion issue in your liver, a mineral imbalance, or adrenal issues. Depending on whether your Ft4 or Ft3 is higher narrows testing down more. The key with endocrine dyfunction is thorough testing.

However it has gotten me more effective treatment than my mom and her sisters combined. Now I get to work on them. PCOS is polycystic ovary syndrome. You do not have to have cysts on the ovaries. Ovary cyst development is a later manifesting symptom for most. PCOS is also a newer term or label given to insulin resistance. If you have a GTT showing hypoglycemic behavior, and elevated DHEA, and Elevated Estrogen and Testosterone with elevated IGF. There are more blood tales like high triglycerides and high good cholesterol versus bad cholesterol. . but if you get the targeted tests and the trend is there including the LH/FSH ratio 3 or greater. .

Thanks for asking! I would like to have the ranges on your Fts. i can not comment on balance or level with out a range for your test. Your TSH shows you are still hypoT big time and in need of thyroid supplementation, you are no where near the optimal 0.89-1.1 window. The RHG result needs more information before I can comment as well. However that does look low when I look back at my levels. . As to PCOS and reactive HG I recommend extended release Metformin. It has worked wonders for me. How I got to the level I needed was to start at 500 mg and increase to 1000 mg at two weeks with a final increase to 1500 mg 6 weeks after that. It really help with my muscle fatigue and energy issues. You will also benefit from changing your eating habits and diet. RHG means more protien and fiber and less preprocessed carbs. You have to balance your sugar intake as well. Think of constant healthy snacking all day long with the occasional naughty indulgence. I eat small balance meals every 3 hours. Fruit/veggies, protien, & fiber. I keep my sugar intake monitored with regards to candy, starches (potatoes and pasta can be evil ), and my downfall. . SODA. I love carbonated beverages and chocolate during the monthly times. *sigh* All in all there are many sites rich in dietary plans and information for hypoglycemics. Your GP should be willing to set you up with a visit to a nutritionist. It helps to have someone walk you through how much is healthy and give you some general guidelines. I went in well educated and thinking it would be a waste of time, but my nutritionist had MANY great ideas and was very supportive. The Weight Watchers I follow was a very hypoglycemia friendly diet plan as well. It all has to do with eating healthy and cutting out the excess and unnecessary junk. I do miss big meals with my family, but I have learned that while I may eat a 3rd what they eat at one time. . I eat more often and can still enjoy my food. As to not eating as much at any given meal time, I have the free time to sit with them and talk and just enjoy my meal times... while they shovel. I am glad that my knowledge has helped you lower the boom on your MDs. Nothing like leading them by the ear or nose hairs. Hopefully you will get all your issues under control. Keep us posted.

Just wondering who out there might have Syndrome X and what you are doing to handle the condition? Any news? Any new breakthroughs? Anyone diagnosed with the autoimmune thing yet? kat "}, "1": {"a": "16674", "t": "Hi J, Have Cognitive behavioral therapy and Tai Chi and Yoga breathing been enough to keep you off the medicines? Has anyone mentioned the cross association with Cystic Ovaries for Women also known as Dysmetabolic Syndrome X? Have you heard anything on the connection to autoimmune disorders? My Endocrinologist tells me that in the problems associated with the Ovary thing and Endo that auto immune disorders seem to eventually manifest although they have not been able to link it with one specific like Lupus or Fibromyalgia. I read an article recently that states that Syndrome X is treatable by reducing body weight to fall within 20% of the ideal weight calculated for age and height coupled with a low calorie, low-cholesterol diet with fruits, vegetables, and fiber and aerobic exercise. Additionally the article I read stated that there are no medications that directly reverse the insulin resistance that causes syndrome X. However, I fit all the criteria for controling the Dysmetabolic process. I've been pretty active and healthy living. I'm athletic (or was until I got real sick)and I look amazingly healthy with regards to low body fat. The big factor in my case comes down to terrible genetics and it's with out a doubt that genetics plays a huge role. In our family it eerily even comes down to age and what appears to be genetic timing. My Dad died at 48. I began to do the huge spiral into serious health problems at 46. My family and personal medical history reads like a text book metabolic disaster. I also take Metformin 3X a day which is a medication that is used to make the Insulin Resistent cells in the body more sensitve to the available Insulin. So what I am wondering is, if there might be a number of people who have been fortunate enough to happen across some workable medical answers that are proving to benefit the problems of the syndrome. I can tell you for sure that Metformin works amazingly well. The Endocrinologist is keeping me on it even though he has already taken out my remaining Ovary. He's thinking that profolactic treatment of the Insulin problem might help to keep me from becoming Diabetic. So have you had any experience with Metformin(Glucophage) Or have you tried any of the other meds? Have you become Diabetic yet? Is your Blood Pressure controled? You think stuff like Tai Chi and Yoga are enough in the exercise area? My Cardiologist told me that he didn't think the yoga I do was sufficient. I'm doing a stationaly bike now with those movable handles. He thinks that's good because it's a cardio workout. That or walking. I've had to change my pre surgery/ illness activities since my present state of physical health prevents me from leading the real active life I had pre health disaster. Have you gone from mega active to more sedate modes of exercise? Or have you always kept mostly to meditative practices? And I'll bet everyone has told you it's stress and anxiety too? Yeh right. It's only stress and anxiety in as much as one has the uncomfortable awareness that ones body has become a little beyond ones capacity for mind control. Or at least in my case that seems to be the flaw. Sorry for all the questions I'm on a personal research mission here. Trying to find the best approach. kat "}, "2": {"a": "16674", "t": "I'm glad you don't have that X mess J. Actually the Metformin(Glucophage) seems to do an excellant job on anxiety.

You need to be off of steroidal supplements of inflammation aides (advil-naproxem sodium) for 4-6 weeks/2weeks respectively. Minimal adrenal testing should involve especially if you are having female cycle issues: ACTH, Cortisol, DHEA, Progesterone, Estrogen, and Testosterone for a female. These should be a fasting 8 am blood draw during your ovulation cycle. . ~15 days post period. An ACTH stim tests looks at the above in addition to Pregnenolone and a aldosterone and others according to the MDs wishes. It is a good idea if you are not on anything to see how your adrenals react to stimulation. It can show that your pituitary gland is hypo in nature or that your adrenals are fatigued/dead. It will only work if you are not on steroids and BCs. Certain hormones are even biased by beta-blockers. Aldosterone is a companion to Cortisol. BCs/estrogen and beta-blockers affect Aldosterone results and levels. You need to be off BCs and beta-blockers to effectively test Aldosterone. Aldosterone and Cortisol work together to regulate stess and inadvertently thyroid T4 to T3 conversion.

My neck REALLY hurts . . anytime I try to lift my head for those crunches . . it is like my thyroid or something in that are is a tight ball and won't allow it to move forward without TOOOOO much strain. . any body knows what's going on ?

Aren't you going on vacation to meet up with a certain friend before you go. Forgive me, I'm a bit out of the loop but I thought that was part of the plan. Anyway hun, I'm thinking of you and hoping that all goes smoothly.

Well, not long now, in another few days you are going to be posting your BFP!!! Kari I saw a little note from you to me. Thank you for your well wishes and yes, we are all doing much better now. I have been thinking of you and wondering how you were getting on. I see AF still hasn't made her grand appearance. I'm hoping (as I know you are) that she gets her A into G and starts soon! Mapia Not long now - I don't know how you are managing to contain your excitement so well! I really hope your darling little niece is born before you go but she certainly does seem to be taking her time doesn't she...... . hopefully it means she is going to be a lovely laidback little lady. I keep getting butterflies every time I think of my impending appointment and it is not until the 29th!

I am keeping everything crossed for you that you get the good news you deserve tomorrow.

Good luck hun and please know that you are in my thoughts. *****BABYDUST***** Ruby "}, "35": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly What can I say except to echo the sentiments of the other ladies? I am so very sorry for you. It is so hard to just pick up the pieces and keep going when you don't know which direction you are headed. I pray that with a little more time and perseverance that your dream to become a mother becomes a reality. I will be thinking of you today and am sending you lots of love and hugs. Ruby "}, "36": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I can understand why BF is feeling the way he is but you have nothing to lose (except your sanity) by trying one last time at the IUI. It may not work but you will never know unless you give it another go. I know that IVF is your best option though so if the two of you feel that you want to take a break while waiting for another opportunity at it then it will probably do you a world of good. I hope you're okay and that you manage to come to a decision about what to do soon. Ruby "}, "37": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly Just thought I'd quickly stop by and say hello. How are you?

I wish you lots of luck for your own appointment. I hope you get the news you want to hear and are able to start on the injectables straight away. Good luck to you and have a great time at your family get together! Hi to you Kelly and thanks for thinking of me! Ruby "}, "39": {"a": "3147", "t": "Oh poor Holly! When it rains it pours doesn't it? I hope you're feeling better again soon, is it some kind of tummy bug you have? If so then I can truly sympathise with you, there is nothing worse. As for the car trouble, I hope you manage to get that fixed quickly with minimum expense. How was your family get together? Hope you had a great time! Ruby "}, "40": {"a": "3147", "t": "Okay sweetie, now I'm going to offer you the same advice that you very kindly gave to me when I was sick. Take it easy, put your feet up and if you can stomach it then have some chicken noodle soup. If not, keep your fluids up even if you haven't actually been sick. Look after yourself hun. Thinking of you and next time I check in with you I hope you're feeling better - I hate it when my friends are sick. Ruby "}, "41": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I'm so glad to hear you are feeling better, those stomach bugs really suck!

Ruby "}, "42": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I'm so sorry your appointment was disappointing - I can relate to that this week myself! I know how badly you want to do the injectables and it's always so disheartening when our RE's won't fulfill our wishes. I wish you the best of luck for this cycle though and I am keeping everything crossed that he find's a recipient couple for you soon so you can have another bash at the IVF (if you still need to after this cycle which hopefully you won't). Try and take it easy Holl, you are always working so hard and you haven't been well this week. Get BF to give you some TLC. Sending you lots of love and babydust! Ruby "}, "43": {"a": "3147", "t": "Oh good, I'm glad you're taking it easy! Have fun at the picnic tomorrow and a great weekend and here's hoping that next time we chat you are in the 2ww! Ruby "}, "44": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I am also at the stage now where I do not expect a BFP but am always hopeful for one. I'm sure our time is just around the corner though. If your BF is anything like my DH then he probably loves it when your ovulating. Men are just like little boys sometimes and act as though they are all put out and doing us a favour but secretly they love it. Tell him to lap it up while it lasts because once you have your baby (which will be very soon now) you might find that sex is the last thing from your mind........... . for a little while anyway! Love to you! Ruby "}, "45": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly Don't worry, I can be pretty irrational myself sometimes - it's hard to think straight when your going through all of this IF stuff. BF is a lucky man to have you and you are going to be wonderful parents one day soon. I also think about baby names all the time. At this stage we have Luke for a boy and Lilly or Milly for a girl. Who knows, by the time I finally have another little one I may have changed my mind. I think it is good to have names all picked out as most babies 'grow' into their names eventually anyway even if they don't suit the name you have picked when they are first born. Hope you are well, it is a beautiful day here today and I am off to watch DS play rugby soon. Have a lovely day my sweet! Ruby "}, "46": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly Just wanted to stop by and say hello. You and I seem to be like ships passing in the night lately, we never seem to be logged on at the same time- darn time zones.

I hope your renovations are looking good and that you are keeping well - take care! "}, "47": {"a": "3147", "t": "OMG you guys have me cracking up over here - great minds think alike eh! Holly, it is a fantastic thing that we can offer one another support regardless of the miles between us. Infact, it just dawned on me recently that I am a much more positive and happy person in regards to my IF since joining this board. Being able to get and give advice and support makes it so much easier and I love knowing that I have friends all over the world with whom I can share my most intimate experiences. I definitely consider you guys to be great friends! Have a wonderful time at the wedding and whatever you do DON'T steal any cake or you won't be getting any more invites! Ruby "}, "48": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I'm glad you had a good time at the wedding. I love weddings but like Amy said in another thread they make me feel quite nostalgic about my own wedding day. It's great that your BF is so keen to do another round of IVF. It shows he is just as committed as you are. He sounds like a great guy. Hope your weekend is going good - raining here today - grrrrrrrr! Ruby "}, "49": {"a": "3147", "t": "It is nice and I've enjoyed chatting with you today. However, it is now 11.00 am and I'm still in my pyjamas. DH just called me and said that my mum is coming over later (probably wants to inspect our paint job - haha) so I must go and get dressed now. I didn't even make it to Mass today but I promise I'll say a special prayer for you all later. Talk to you later! Ruby "}, "50": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I can be very lazy sometimes especially in the weekends. My mum was very impressed with the paint job - I think she was pleasantly surprised. How are you? I hope you're enjoying your weekend and that you're not feeling too anxious yet. Like you said earlier, the first part of the 2ww is by far the easiest but you are getting closer now. I am hoping so hard that you get a BFP but you must be relieved knowing that you have a back up plan just in case. Take care hun! Ruby "}, "51": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I don't blame you one bit for not being able to sleep last night - this is just far too exciting!!! I can't wait to see you post your BFP. I have no idea where I am in my cycle, I've stopped counting the days. I know I'm in the 2ww though and it's all written in my diary so I can work it all out at any time. I'm trying not to get too focused this month as I know after my HSG next month I am going to find the 2ww all consuming. Babydust to you sweet Holly - it's great to hear you so happy and excited. Ruby "}, "52": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly As I type this I hope you are sleeping peacefully and dreaming of your near future baby!

Ruby "}, "53": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly You took the words right out of my mouth! Being sleep deprived now is great practice for when you have a little one to contend with several times throughout the night! Hi Lizzie It's great having you back - I've really missed you! Hi Christin Thanks for that little scenario - wouldn't that be the ultimate blessing! I hope you're right. It's lovely having you back - no more disapperaing acts okay!?! Love to you all! Ruby "}, "54": {"a": "3147", "t": "Obviously men are the same the world over as my DH is just as bad as all of yours. Bless him, he does try very hard but sometimes I think it's easier just to do the cooking and washing up myself! I'm glad you managed to have a better night's sleep last night Holly. Being sleep deprived is no fun at all though like you I can't wait until the day I am complaing about being tired becuase I've been up all night feeding my new baby - I get excited just thinking about it. Anyway, after all the trouble we have gone through just to get PG I think we deserve to have perfect newborns who sleep right through the night from day one! I hope everybody is doing well and Lizzie, hang in there my sweet. I posted a note on your thread but I want you to know I'm still keeping my fingers crossed for you. Bye for now! Ruby "}, "55": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly I too have just stopped by to say hello. How are you today? It sounds as though you are in good spirits - yay! As of Monday I may not be around to post quite so much. One of my very dear girlfriends has just started up her own optometrist's business and she has asked me to work part time out the back. I jumped at the oportunity as it has now been ten years since I last worked a proper job. Now both the kiddies are at school I feel I need something to stimulate me a bit more while waiting for my BFP. I'm really going to miss you guys though so I will still be checking up on all of you as often as possible...... I just mightn't get an opportunity to write so much. Love you lots and know that I am always thinking of you all. Ruby "}, "56": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly Don't worry your time is coming too and you will be doing your IVF before you know it. Im so excited for you, I can't wait until we are all announcing our BFP's. Bittersweet is the perfect word for IF. We dream and we hope but we are all so afraid too. Our time IS coming though. Love to you and glad you're doing well. Ruby Oh, I'm sorry I took over your thread a bit by posting about my new job. I should have posted that news on the Ruby thread. Thanks for being excited for me! "}, "57": {"a": "3147", "t": "Hi Holly Thank God you don't have to answer all those questions again. That's another hard part of IF, having your personal life intruded upon. At least this time you can focus yourself 100&#37; on the cycle without worrying about taking a 'test'. Anyway, I just wanted to stop by and touch base with you - I miss you! Bye for now and hopefuly I'll catch up with a few more threads later.

A break from AF does sound great though I must say that she is still a no-show for me this month and I am rather anxious for her to get started as you already know. Not much I can do about it so I shouldn't complain. Like you say, I hope before long that she stays away from all of us for a good long nine months. Take care Holly Dolly!

I can't believe how close you are getting now. I'm sorry your appointment with the nurse was cancelled but now you have something to look forward to next week instead - and it's the same day as my HSG so we can hold each others hand and send one another lots of positive vibes!

I have a great feeling about it simply because of the way everything fell into place so nicely for you - as if it is meant to be!

I just couldn't believe what I was reading and I can't express how sorry I am. You are so incredible for looking on the bright side when most people would just crawl into bed and cry. You are correct in saying that you are destined to be a mum and if you keep trying it will happen - and what a mum you will be!!! I'm thinking of you sweetie and hope that you are okay. I really do feel for you right now and hope that you manage to enjoy the weekend. Love and hugs.

I hope you're managing to enjoy your weekend. Is it starting to get a bit cooler over there now? I hope you don't think I'm being irresponsible, but yes, I think am going to try this month. I did my first OPK last night and I think I am getting very close to Oing. It is Monday tomorrow so I'll ring and check with my RE just in case but I don't want to waste all those lovely follies.

Amy - I am so sorry to hear about your friend's baby, it is just terrible. The same thing happened to my sister's SIL at 39 weeks and it took all of us a long time to get over it.

I really can't believe how close I feel to my cyber friends and it saddens me to think we will probably never meet. I am so thankful for modern technology and the chance to interact with people in the same situation as me. Sounds like you had a good weekend.

I think it's great that although you are so busy you still find the time to consistently post on here. I find that by the time I have five minutes to myself I am too tired to do much more than check my e-mails (and sometimes not even that!) . Of course, you girls are always in my thoughts though and I do miss you all a lot. How are you keeping?

The weather is just starting to fine up here now and infact I have just gotten home from a huge shopping spree to stock up on summer clothes - pity it wasn't maternity wear I was buying but a bit of retail therapy works wonders for the soul regardless.

But darling, I really think you shoudl call--- you have say in it. or see if there is another recipient couple--- or if they can put you on the top of a donor list or something. If the recipient couple is wanting eggs-- they must kno what it's like to want children very badly, too, right? Is there any chance they might understand how you feel? You know what? I really want to tell you to \"Chin up! Your BFP will get here!\" I do believe that, It WILL be here, darling. But for now, I think you have every right to go into the bathroom, have a little sob, call the nurse, and go home. You do need time to grieve over this darling. Maybe there is something you can do in the mean time? I know IVF is the best bet, but maybe you can do an IUI while you're waiting? Then maybe you wont even have to do IVF I can only imagine how saddened you are darling friend. You won't have to wait much longer, I believe that. You deserve a little one so much. I kniw you probably don't want to hear that, because it mght make you even more sad/ But someday, you WILL be a mother. I am praying for you and wishing SO HARD that I could be there fo ryou.

Unfortunately, I just got out of a meeting at work and checked my voicemail, and there was a message from my nurse postponing my appt again! This time she said the recipient couple has decided they want to get through the holidays and would rather do the cycle in January or February. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. I haven't even called her back yet to see if I have any say in this at all. I am just so frustrated. That means I spent the last 3 weeks on bcp for nothing. I feel like my bfp is never gonna get here. So much for everything falling into place and being pg by Christmas. I just want to go home and crawl into bed. What if they change their minds again between now and then and decide to cancel the cycle altogether? How much longer do I have to wait? Holly "}, "126": {"a": "17146", "t": "Oh girls, I don't know what I would do without all of you! Thank you, thank you, thank you for understanding the way I feel. Well, I am still incredibly frustrated that the last 3 weeks were wasted on bcp and that we have to wait even longer for our IVF cycle, but I have decided to look for the silver linings in the situation...it is the only way I will get through it. Now we will have more time to get our finances in order and pay for the cycle w/o any additional stress. Come January/February, I will be in a new semester, and I will be taking 3 less credits than I am taking this semester, which also means less stress. BF wants to visit his mom for Thanksgiving, and we didn't think it would be possible due to the cycle, but now that will probably be able to happen. I guess there are some good things that come from waiting. I called my nurse back and she could hear the disappointment in my voice. She explained that the husband cannot be in town the week of e/r, and the wife was becoming manic worrying that the cycle would be a waste. Since they are paying so much money (about the cost of 2 cycles), they don't want to freeze his sperm if they don't have to. When she explained the circumstances to me, I was a little less disappointed. I told her that I am concerned they will cancel the cycle altogether, and she tried to assure me that will not happen. I hope she is right. I picture the wife getting all worried about not having the best chance possible, and I have to hope they want this as badly as me. I did ask about doing an IUI this cycle (I'm currently on CD2), and she told me to call the main office and leave a message for the dr. Only thing is, BF is at work and unreachable at the moment, and I don't want to sign up for a cycle w/o talking to him about it first. Anyway, I just wanted you all to know that I'm okay, and I'm sorry my last post was so depressing. I was just shocked and disappointed. Thank you so much for your caring words. I just drank my first cup of caffinated coffee in about 3 weeks. Love you all!! Holly "}, "127": {"a": "17146", "t": "You ladies really overwhelm me w/ your kind words. You make me feel like I am destined to be a mother, and it will definitely happen some day as long as I keep trying. As supportive as you all have been to me, I know that you will all make fantastic mothers yourself. There is no way God is not going to grant us children. If only we could end all the waiting and wondering and worrying and fast forward to that moment when the healthy bfp is confirmed. Then we could experience pg, get to labor, and fast forward that part too and just wake up holding our little angels. HA HA! Hey, I have a right to dream, right? Well, I'm getting ready to leave work now, so I will let you all know if IUI is a possibility this cycle or not. I guess I should know by tomorrow after talking w/ bf and if he wants to go forward checking w/ the dr. Have a good night everyone. And thanks for helping me through yet another IF disappointment. Holly "}, "128": {"a": "17146", "t": "Princess, you are so sweet. I hope your holiday weekend has started off perfectly. I wonder if your mom has arrived yet. Can't wait to hear all about it! Luba, I do agree that it's not fair that I have no say in the schedule. But, money talks, and they are the ones forking over 3 times as much as me, so I guess they do have a right to try to optimize their chances as much as possible. The whole cycle should be less stressful for all of us after the holidays, so maybe we will all have better results. Lizzie, you said exactly what I was thinking. I too was angry at the recipient couple at first. Then when my nurse explained their reasons for postponing, I remembered that they are real people with real issues, and they need to do what is best for them no matter what. Ruby, believe me I am disappointed. I'm just trying to make the best out of the situation since there is nothing I can do to change it. I am going to have to wait whether I spend days crying about it or not. I definitely shed some tears after I got the message about postponing the cycle, but I am refusing to let myself stay down about it. So, about the IUI...BF and I talked it over last night, and we aren't going to try our last IUI while waiting for the IVF. His reasoning is that it might be put to better use after the IVF if things don't work out the way we hope. If we get pg and m/c again, maybe the IUI would work the next month since everybody says it is easier to get pg again right after a m/c. And if the IVF doesn't work at all, then at least we will have that one last try at IUI as something to look forward to and hopefully soften the disappointment. I'm fine w/ not doing the IUI right now. We can try naturally this month, I have plenty of OPK's sitting at the house just waiting for me to pee on them. Today is CD3 anyway, and my dr prescribes clomid/femara from CD3 - 7, so it would have been a pain to get the script filled on time. That's just more money we can set aside for the upcoming IVF cycle. Thanks again ladies for all the support. I feel so lucky to be a part of this community. You all are the best sisters a girl could ask for! Holly "}, "129": {"a": "17146", "t": "Princess, it's nice to hear from you today - I thought your weekend was starting early for some reason. I think you should try to convince your mom to stay a few extra days. Christin, you are soooo right. Life certainly isn't fair, or all of us would have our little ones by now. But, this is the hand we've been dealt, and all we can do is make the best of it. I will be praying we both have natural miracles before the time for our IVF cycles arrives. And if not, at least we will be able to support one another through it. I did notice that I seemed to be the only one on the boards preparing for IVF in Nov, and it will be nice to have some cycle buddies. Amy, thank you so much. You are always so supportive of me. It really was terribly disappointing hearing we would have to wait longer, but what can we do? Hopefully the long wait will be worth it, and the cycle will go flawlessly w/ the healthiest bfp EVER. Lizzie, I'm glad so many people think it's wise to wait on the IUI. I probably never would've made that decision on my own, but I completely understand and support BF's reasoning. It sounds like everybody else does too, which makes me even more confident that we made the right decision. I too wonder if the recipient couple realizes how anxious I am to get started. They have to know how much this means to me, right? I mean, it must mean a great deal to them, so hopefully they can understand I feel the same way. I know that this time they had a good reason, but if they end up postponing again, I will seriously consider requesting a different recipient couple to cycle w/. I can't take many more setbacks!

It doesn't hurt that I'm secretly hoping for a miracle before January. You never know... Princess, you are so funny.

I've been thinking about it, and I can't understand why your dr would have put you on clomid if you weren't supposed to try this month. Aimee, you are so sweet. Thank you. How are you doing?

I'm definitely a warm weather type of girl. I am actually having a really nice weekend, thanks for asking. BF took me shopping today, and we got a new set of pots and pans and a couple small appliances for the kitchen. It's always nice to get new things for the house.

But that's because I depend on the support I receive from everyone so much that I don't know what I'd do if this forum didn't exist. I guess that is the beauty of it. Ruby, it was fun shopping! I always love spending BF's money. I didn't cook anything on Saturday because we went out, but I did break in the pots yesterday. I always cook a big meal on Sundays. He coaches mini football, and his team always has their games on Sundays. Then after the game, a few guys will come over and watch the professional games on tv.

I cannot imagine how difficult it would be to lose a pg at that stage. I am a little disappointed you haven't had any weird cravings. I think it is so neat when the baby wants something the mother doesn't usually eat. CBB, I hope you enjoyed your weekend away. Did you go anywhere fun? Thanks for the encouragement. It sure does suck having to wait all this extra time, but I am still looking at the silver linings, and it really does seem like things will work out better this way.

It helped that BF is an excellent cook and taught me everything I know. The best tip I can give you is to prepare as much as you can the night before. And just try to enjoy yourself. If you have fun with it, I'm sure everything will turn out delicious. Princess, your post made me smile. I can't wait for the day I am cooking for my little ones!!

I'm really hoping for January! Amy, I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking. How are you doing? BF always gets away w/o helping me clean up the kitchen after the dinner guests. It is usually just easier to do things myself. He does help out in other areas of the house, but he is not very good at washing dishes or wiping the stove down (I secretly think he might do a bad job on purpose so that I will leave him alone ) I don't mind though. I like my kitchen a certain way. Jenna, thank you so much for your kind words! I really hope I will be a great mommy some day. The time has been passing pretty quickly, and hopefully once the holidays get here, it will fly by even faster! How are you doing? I'm glad to see we are all for a spa getaway.

I jumped to 100 mcgs to get into the 50-60% range of normal. I have a bit longer to wait and see where I am now. My MFM and OB want me to get to 60-80% before my husband and I try to conceive a second time. SO we are pushing things. The thyroid hormones are slowly getting where they need to be. Taking the metformin and hydrocortisone resulted in the quickest alleviation of specific symptoms. Getting the thyroid hormones right has the biggest effect on my body temperature regulation, memory, and metabolism. The muscle aches, cramps, head aches, nausea, EXTREME fatigue, migraines, and more were alleviated by correcting my hypoglycemic diet habits, adding metformin and supplementing my hypoadrenalism. MG "}, "2": {"a": "4333", "t": "Metformin is normally a life long deal. Some can drop it when diet and lack of exercise are the contributing factor to excessive weight and insulin resistance. If however you are eating responsibly and exercising and still have weight issues and need Metformin. . well you are probably going to be stuck with it. Until your thyroid levels are stable and you are at an optimal weight and eating a hypoglycemic diet I wouldn't risk dropping the Metformin. As to adding DHEA when estrogen dominant. Hummm. . well that is a toss up. Your DHEA level was 38.9% of normal range. My MD considers 40-60% of normal range optimal. You are almost there. I would hold off on adding DHEA and instead work on the thyroid balance. When your levels get balanced the DHEA may bump up naturally. Was the DHEA level pre-metformin?

Okay you can have tablets that are 10 mg to 25 mg. Dosing for DHEA is tricky. According to my MD, You should start with 10 mg in the morning a day. Wait at least two weeks and look for the very blatant TOO much for you signs of oily hair and skin and acne. If 10 mg seems to do nothing after a period of 2 weeks you can boost it to 15 mg... hold for 2 weeks and wait on the symptoms. . if none arise but your still feeling Blah, you can boost to 20 mg a day. My MD does not recommend taking more than 20 mg a day. If 20 mg a days doesn't cut it. . then the adrenal cortisol and aldosterone and pregnenolone levels must be evaluated and looked into. You should call and double check the regime you plan to use with your MD. It will help in you care if you keep them in the loop and up to date on your supplement regime.

Best thing to do is some resistance training or weight lifting.

On one hand, high glucose levels cause damage and the sooner you get to them, the better. The problem is that they can be so effective in the short term, that people don't make the lifestyle changes : diet, exercise and weight control. These three are mandatory. But meds make it easier to cheat on them. Some think and it's yet to be proven that meds will only work for a certain amount of time If you don't make the lifestyle changes and the med effectiveness runs out, what do you do ? Weight loss makes a huge difference. When dropping 60lbs I dropped my 1ac from 7.8% to 5.1% and fasting from 12 to 5.1. This was without low carbing it.Yes I excercised to lose the weight, but even when I stopped, my glucose levels stayed flat if I maintained the healthy weight....for a while. Weight loss is very hard, but it does work. But time caught up with me and I had to increase exercise and diet control to keep the 1ac under control. But I deferred meds by 11 years so far. Hopefully I can hold them off a few more. I do not fool myself, eventually I will need them. The lifestyle changes can make all the difference.

Long term, keep those levels up will hurt you. Chances are they have been up for a while so theoretically a few weeks more or less will not make a huge difference. Don't panic, you don't need more stress. But act upon it. You should push to get to see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible. If you can't see one and can't get access to meds, you do still have a certain amount of control In the mean time, I would go out and get a glucose meter. I would start reading as much as possible from reputable sites. I would start exercising, maybe starting with something not too intense like walking. Try to read up on carbohydrates and glycemic index. In the very short term if you want to go low carb, try following the Atkins diet. Then as you get things under control and gain more knowledge you will find a diet more appropriate to your needs. But Atkins is one place to start. I am not a believer in everything it says, but some of the books give a very concise explanation of low carb, fibre, glycemic index etc. Don't get too excited by the 'miracle' products like cinnamon, bitter melon . . etc. And of course, ask lots of questions here. There is a ton of info in the various threads. "}, "4": {"a": "22460", "t": "I used Metformin but it didn't do anything for me so I stopped. However I learned a few things. Most people get used to it and the upset stomachs don't last that long. They gradually up the dose so your system gets use to it. They put me on slow release Metformin. I asked for it because it was more convenient, ie, I only had to take it once a day and it slowly released into my system. But afterward I found out it upsets the stomach less. It was sold under the name Glucophage XR. "}, "5": {"a": "1642", "t": "I'm not sure about the insulin-sensitizing drugs working for only a period of time...I do know that the older meds, the sulfonylureas, actually made the pancreas work harder and did, indeed, hasten the need to use insulin, but I was under the impression that the newer meds did not. Regardless, Pinnig, I think your doctor is absolutely out in left field in your case. Your fasting blood glucose was quite high (220 in US terms, when normal is 100 or less, or 5.5 in UK terms), and your two hour was over 300. It's going to take several months for diet and exercise to improve those numbers significantly and meanwhile you could have some serious damage going on. Let's face it...you've probably already been running high for months. Admittedly it's just my opinion, but I'd insist on going on metformin right away and then, if you do lose a lot of weight, you might be able to get off it. Frankly, I'd worry less about what might happen 10-15 years down the road insofar as insulin is concerned and I'd worry a lot more about the damage being done right now by high blood sugars. Itotito...good point about medications lulling people into not making the lifestyle changes necessary, but it's impossible to predict who will get complications and who won't, and some people get them very quickly. I just think it's imperative for people to get their numbers down asap. Ruth "}, "6": {"a": "1642", "t": "TJLHB and Itotito said it all...no need to panic over a few weeks delay; do all you can on your own now to get the numbers down.

Ruth "}, "7": {"a": "1642", "t": "Wow, Pinning...when you make up your mind to do something, you really do it! Your dietary changes are obviously having a great effect on your blood glucose levels, and hopefully knowing that you've already reduced that awful feeling of fatigue will inspire you to keep it up. With these dietary changes you will also probably lose some weight and that in turn will help keep your levels down. Good for you...and do keep us posted. Ruth "}, "8": {"a": "1642", "t": "Excellent so far, Pinnig...sounds like you've already made some great progress. I agree with the nurse...the advice to eat a starchy diet is counterproductive. Starchy foods are usually very high-glycemic, and will shoot your numbers way up. As for medication, as everyone else said, it won't hurt to wait a few weeks. Here in the USA, one would usually be put on medication if your A1c was over 6.0. So you do have a ways to go, but as you lose weight, you may be able to reach that or, as I mentioned before, you might want to start on medications right away and then see if you can get off them if you lose enough weight. Sometimes it can be done, sometimes it can't...each case is very individual, regardless of weight loss. Just because you're feeling better (and thank goodness you ARE), it doesn't mean that damage isn't still being done. Unfortunately, higher than normal blood sugars can do damage even when we're feeling fine. I'd push for the medication if I were you...but be sure they don't put you on sulfonylureas. The preferred medication for T2 is glucophage (metformin). You might have to start on a very low dose, as it can upset the stomach, but most people find that if they start on a sub-therapeutic dose and gradually increase up to the optimal dose they can avoid the GI upset. Anyway, good luck with the appointment next week. It sounds like you're very motivated to make the necessary lifestyle changes. If you keep it up, you'll be just fine!

Sounds like a double dose of insulin to me. My understanding of type two diabetes is that the pancreas secretes too much insulin because the insulin isn't as effective as it should be. Hard for me to imagine a doctor ok'ing such a thing but I am new to this. ...I highly recommend that you find a site that explains carbohydrate metabolism to substantiate what I'm about to say so here goes. Insulin controls high glucose levels by turning glucose into glycogen. If the glycogen levels continue to increase, the glycogen will eventually turn into fat. when blood sugar levels start to drop from the insulin two things have to happen to keep the blood sugar from falling too low. Either we have to eat or the Pancreas Secretes Glucagon. The glucagon changes the glycogen back into glucose. ...There's a catch however, if there is still insulin in the blood stream, the pancreas will not secrete glucogon so your either left with waiting for the adrenal gland to raise the glucose levels or you have to eat. As you can see, if your always in the mode of making fat, it's going to be very hard to lose any. ...A low Glycemic index diet can alliviate the hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia if you are insulin resistant. The atkins accomplishess the same thing by restricting all carbs and not just the high glycemic ones. . . Anyway, type two diabetes usually means that your insulin resistant and are hyperinsulinemic. That's a big Usually, as there may be other conditions for type two diabetes that I don't know about. That's where it is imperitive for everyone to know their disease or condition. It also helps to know how the metabolism works or it's easy to get stuck in the trap of always making fat which makes it impossible to lose any. ...Research, research, research... later, Rick "}, "1": {"a": "22072", "t": "LMB, ....Please make sure you verify everything I've said. I'm insulin resistant and the excess insulin was causing problems with an inner ear disorder I have. I've done a lot of searching on the internet to find all this information and like I said, I'm very new at this. Based on everything I've read about insulin resistance, I asked my doctor what the difference was between insulin resistance and type two diabetes and he said that there's no difference in the disorder, you just have to have a certain glucose reading (200 I believe) to be classifies as insulin resistance. So based on my knowledge so far, I have the same metabolic disorder as type two diabetes but have yet to reach the severity to be diagnosed with type two. ...As I mentioned in my other post, I went on the Low GI diet and got remarkable results. The whole focus of this treatment is to slow down the rate of metabolism of carbohydrates, which reduces the spike in blood glucose, which then reduces the spike in insulin. The Low GI diet works by telling you which carbs spike the blood sugar and which ones don't and all points inbetween. Of course it's carbs that spike the blood sugar and resulting insulin release, so a reduction in carbs like the Atkins would have the same effect. ...The pills that are given for type two diabetes is Metformin ( again, I haven't taken them and this is all based on what I've learn from type 2 friends of mine and from reading). I believe Metformin works on the same principle of slowing down the metabolism of carbohydrates. ...PCOS, as some one mentioned is also a result of excess insulin levels as can be hypertension. Since being on this diet, my blood pressure has gone from 130/80 to 110/75 and my tryglycerides have dropped from 350 to 97. My HDL cholesterol has finaaly rose to 40 which is normal for the first time in 15 years. So you may see other benefits of a Low GI diet or atkins diet. ...A friend of mine at work, who is type two diabetic, listened to what I was saying about the low GI diet and also tried it. He also had the same effect with tryglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol. His doctor has also cut back on the amount of the Metformin he is taking, so I believe there's some benefit to trying these diets. An important thing to keep in consideration when changing diet is to make sure you don't eliminate your sources of the different vitamins and minerals. That's the only problem that I have had is that when I reduced the amount of potatoes in my diet, I also reduced the amount of potassium I was getting, so I had to find other foods high in potassium. ...When I went on the diet i lost about 20 lbs. I believe that was from getting out of the mode of making fat all the time from the excess insulin. Now I am trying to lower my weight some more by lowering my caloric intake, so I will keep you posted on how that goes. . . Another important note would be to find a doctor that understands all this. My doctor highly recommends this diet and my friends doctor was concerned that it was a fad diet. So there are lot's of uniformed doctors out there that aren't keeping up with the research out there. Dr Jenie Brand-Miller did most of the research on the Low GI diet.

The two are supposed to work together to regulate our blood sugar. As long as the serum levels of insulin is high, then the glucagon phase never kicks in. As far as I know, exercise is the only way weight loss can be accomplished as long as serum insulin levels are high. ...A diet of Low to medium glycemic index foods turned my system around without the exercise. I think it's going to be personal for each person depending on their reaction to carbohydrates. For a person who is really sensitive it may be a combination of eating low index foods only in smaller quantities, more frequently as it sounds you may have started. And of course it may even require one of the drugs like metformin to get there. Sounds like Cobalt blue has the info there. ...One thing in your description that sounds interesting is the fact that you BS is up even after extended fasts. Even without insulin, our BS should come down as we burn the sugar for fuel. If the Glucagon isn't there to replinish the supply, it is my understanding that the adrenal gland releases cortisol and adrenaline to convert the glycogen and fat back into glucose. Cobalt, ....Can a hyperactive adrenal gland make one hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic? I would think one would have the symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia if this were the case.

If I remember correctly, I didn't like my results with it. I'm glad of the reminder that cinnamon is available in capsules, and a lot stronger. At health food stores? My cinnamon toast w/Equal does not seem to be working as well any more. I take Glipizaide in addition to Metformin and used to also take Avandia, looking for something to replace it. Starlix taken before a meal is supposed to prevent sudden spikes. I switched recently from plain Metformin 2000 a day, the limit, to Metformin ER because of heartburn indigestion, now 4 pills a day instead of 2, and my readings don't seem to be as good. I have advanced retinopathy and didn't read on the bottle to take 4, so for about 3 wks I was only taking half my dose, have a recurrence of foot ulcer, on a bunion, which gets infected, recurring, and if it goes to the bone can cause amputation. I'd appreciate any other hints for very long-term diabetics. May even go to classes again when I get some time. My A1c usually is 6.5 but after so many years the complications, which can maybe be delayed or lessened, sometimes happen anyway. Decades ago at diabetes classes we were told one slice of bread three times a day helps with control. The short-lived low-carb diets didn't do us any better than that. I wonder if they still teach that. "}, "1": {"a": "3276", "t": "Hi, Everyone, Sunday morning, I plan to look at some other health food store for maybe 400 MG capsules if there is such a thing. I'm having to take a Pepto-Bismol tablet, and I forget which med should not be taken within 2 hrs of an antacid, but let's remember there is one. Maybe someone knows what it is. Not thyroid, right? Which you take on an empty stomach. The Cinnamon capsules really do help! Just got mine 2 or 3 days ago and morning b.g. has been 90, first day, 83 this morning. It replaces Avandia, which I used to take in addition to Metformin 2000 per day, Glipizide 2X a day, three things. Now Cinnamon is my Avandia. A1c has been 6.5 for a long time, can't seem to get it any lower. Highest ever was something over 8. And I have all sorts of complications. They don't start until about 20 yrs, and may happen even with good control, but you might be able to delay and lessen severity. With proliferative diabetic retinopathy, they laser about 1000 spots at a time, of the rogue new blood vessels that can cause blindness, and of course they use the deadening drops, three times where I go and where I have a gentle woman doctor, but some places, well, just one employee I guess, was adamant that deadening drops one time, after the doctor is actually in the treatment room, was enough, and it was so painful I had to ask him to stop the treatment, knew the woman doctor could do it with little or no pain. Her laser she uses doesn't make noise either. Be forewarned that male doctors sometimes, maybe usually, like to haul out their big guns, almost like an air hammer, to do delicate work in the eye, and I heard about one who actually caused some damage. The patient then went to a university and they were able to repair it. Said he'd used too big a laser. If you ever see big black spots, not just lifelong floaters, you need a retina specialist fast. I was told it was already too late for that eye, but they've managed to save most of it. The treatments cause cataracts, but that happens to a lot of people anyway. Hey, I forget if this is an eye forum or diabetic foot problems, sorry. If it's about feet, a callus when it gets too thick can crack open and get infected, I'm sure everyone knows, and you have to offload the foot, take antibiotics, or could need an amputation if it spreads too far. Usually I need a debridement two or three times when mine flares up, from rubbing in my gardening shoes which I'm throwing away, but my hole closed in only 2 wks this time, when he'd scared me half to death about amputation, thinking I wasn't taking it seriously, and I was really careful to stay off of it, bandage it every day the way he said, took the new antibiotic, etc. One guy who rides in the van service for eye treatments has to go to dialysis 3X a week, which would really be a hardship, so maybe all this will encourage us about control. He's cheerful and grateful to just be alive. I went to diabetes classes, about 3 times, about 20 yrs ago, probably need to go again to catch up on all the latest and maybe get some meal plan ideas. Good luck to everybody.

Just got back from an outdoor band concert where I was supposed to play, two instruments, but took a well-earned leave of absence thinking I might go ahead and have my bunion toes repositioned and you have to wear a (sometimes removable) walking cast for maybe 8 wks, then use crutches for two more. Actually I just now looked it up and found there's now removable casts. They had me scared. It was so great to see the gang of musicians after being out 2 wks.

I have been on it for 6 months now, at my 3 month check up, my doctor rechecked my numbers everything looked good, now I'm a LAZY bum, I do not exercise never have and probably should, but at 3 months I had lost 22 pounds.

Sorry. Here is a bit of history. I AM 26, male, and I was active healthy and happy Overview: June 29th '07, i had gone to the ER with palpitations and high blood pressure(217/120). Prior to this date, i was perfectly healthy. Never been to the ER and never knew what a palpitation was After 5 hours in the ER, the doc said that all my palps and hypertension was caused by GERD? (again, prior to this, what is GERD? I never knew what it was and didnt care) Details: We were in the car heading back from my sisters house about 40 mins from my house. On route, i felt a stinging/pinching in my neck then BOOM... i cant sit still, my heart is beating so hard and fast..... my ears begin ringing..... My wife is driving and is trying to calm me down. It felt as if I had just downed 50 Red Bulls in one sitting. (I dont drink that crap, tastes like battery acid) We get home and i try to lay down... I try to calm down... i cant, i cant sit still. . basically, i go to the ER and the rest is in the overview. Since this little experience, my blood pressure has NOT once returned to normal on its own. I am now on all kinds of meds for anxiety, gastritis and hypertension. I never had prescription anything before... Well, general doc is no help... i seek help from a cardiologist,, he does a 24 hour urinalysis which the results came back elevated for catecholamines and metanephrines... now they suspect a Pheochromocytoma or other type of endocrine tumor. Well, come to find out, i did the 24hour test wrong which caused a false elevation in these hormones... I find this out after two,(thats right) count 'em, thats TWO CT scans of my abdomen searching for adrenal and any other masses in there. both negative... Well, throughout this whole ordeal, i am twitchy, panic-ed, cant sleep well, high blood pressure, tense, lethargic, weak. I am 6'4\" and was really active. I hit 260lbs about mid last year. (my heaviest ever). i liked to remain fit and healthy. Since mid-June I have been losing weight. like i said, i was 260lbs. . now i am 220lbs. I contribute part to lack of appetite to gastritis. Come to find out, I didnt have GERD. Anyways, one common factor since the day I went to the ER, i have been having a brused-like feeling on the left side of my lower neck (under the adams apple). Come to find out, thats where a little gland called the thyroid lives. ( i never knew what a thyroid was or where it even belonged in my 26 years on earth, till now.) I have noticed that sometimes my thyroid would get a bit bigger, tightening my throat. Sometimes it would feel bruised like someone hit it. I finally requested that a doc ultrasound my neck. He decides to CT my neck. They find a 4-mm possible cyst on my right thyroid area. Well, i finally sought the advice from an endocrinologist last week. He took a TON of blood tests, including the FULL thyroid test, not just the TSH. Also metanephrine, catecholamine and pituitary tests. He thinks i may have had a thyroid storm followed by elevated levels of some thyroid related hormone causing hypertension, anxiety and contributing to weight loss and lethargy. However, I go in tomorrow (thursday Aug 30th) for the follow up on my test results and an ultrasound of my neck. I have my hopes set that my thyroid is the cause of all of my ailments. I sure hope it is. I hate my blood pressure being so high and having to be so dependant on all these meds. I feel so crappy. I would expect this about 40 years from now, but I feel too young. I have felt so bad the bast 2 months that i need to do this to raise my spirits. Here is a list of everything i feel fortunate for: -My Wife for taking care of the house, me and the kids. -A site such as this to read and share our ailments (thereputic and educational) -my work for allowing me to work from home the past 2 months. Anyways, back to the question at hand Has anyone either gone hyper or hypo and suddenly found themselves with elevated blood pressure?? If so, did treatment of the thyroid issue result in normal blood pressure?? Thank you for reading and your response is much appreciated. Jim "}, "1": {"a": "55233", "t": "Thank you for your reply.

Not really what i wanted to hear, but i feel better with our process of elimination. I had ultrasound of thyroid and doc said looked ok. The cyst i have is just that, a cyst. only 4mm and nothing to worry about. Just keep an eye on it. Basically all of my test results were within spec, Including thyroid TSH, FT3 and FT4. Full metabolic panel seems normal. Urine metanephries were normal. The only red flag is urine cortisol test. Results: 115.0 Reference range: 4.0 - 50.0 Funny thing is that i had an MRI of my head prior to the visit with my Endo at the request of my PCP. The Endo said since the cortisol is NOT 3x above the max reference range (150) then he doesnt want to call it Cushings yet. I have to repeat the urinalysis in 2 weeks along with a serum cortisol and ACTH test. I have muscle weakness, lethargy, weight loss, irritability, hypertension, headaches just to name a few. i hope there can be a resolution to this soon.

I have been having blood sugar problems for a year or two now and have had a glucose test that came out fine. I have been testing my blood sugar lately since my mother got a machine after finding out she's has Diabetes. I finally remembered to test it when I felt as if my blood sugar were low (tired, weak, light headed, burning cheeks, etc) and it said I was at 272! I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow. After an hour my sugar level had dropped to 100, which is a fast drop rate, from what my mother says (she's an RN). A funny thing is, I got a psychological test when i was 12. They had no idea what was wrong with me. I had started puberty at 9, and started having periods at 10. This is also when i rapidly gained weight. They just stuck me on cylert and stopped at that. At 16 they finally realized I had PCOS (diagnosed, not yet tested) and put me on birth control. Only then did my moods stop. No kicking holes in doors, no screaming fits, no depression, no erratic periods, and basically i felt a lot better. I quit taking the cylert at 18 due to money issues and soon discovered I have ADD. I cannot focus well and my grades immediately dropped from A's to B's and C's. So it's quite stupid that my mother put out over $1,000 and they didn't want to say \"oh it's not mental, so it must be something else.\" I was a demon to my mother.

My doctor changed me from Low Ovral to Yasmine and I had some weird symptoms at first but it's regulated now. It's amazing what kinds of things hormones can cause. My doctor told me the 272 blood sugar reading was most likey a fluke, as this test they do that runs a blood sugar average over the past few months showed 80's (normal). She says it's all hormonal and asked me to watch my carb and sugar intake. For the ADD she is sending me to a Psychiatrist to get the medicine. And, I have an ear infection. My second one in a row.

My mom is on the diabetic diet and i'm learning a lot from her. I didn't realize carbs like rice, bread, and pasta metabolize into sugar.

I'm also an avid meat lover, but i do love tofu and chicken breasts that that's alright. Looking in her carb and fat counter i was amazed at the amounts in fast food. I did learn, though, that if you take the mayonnaise off the grilled chicken at McDonalds you remove almost 200 calories. Yea sense is good, but will power is too. I do gain weight around the center of my body. My arms (not upper) and calves are relatively thin but my calves are very muscular. I can't do too much walking because the weight on my upper body (chest) puts too much pressure on my back. So I got an excersize bike and that is supposed to be good for me. I also am a BIG fan of Tybo. The Yasmine is doing good for me and I hope to eventually get laser to remove some of the facial hair. I think they should have more information out here on PCOS.

My OB changed my BC Pill to Ovcon 35 and I am finishing the 2nd month of it. Well, I am due for my period in about 11 days. I started break through bleeding 3 days ago. It is heavy like a period with all symptoms that go with a period. (I had break through bleeding last month too but it was more like spotting but still all the symptoms that go on with a period) I am also having pain in my left Ovary, I think I am ovulating which you are not suppose to do on the pill. That is how I developed the massive cysts I had. I spoke to my OB today, and he wants me to double up on my BC Pill and call him when I am done. I asked him are we going to change my pill and he said probably yes. I asked him which pill he might put me on, and he said we will cross that bridge when we get to it. I also asked him am I going to get another massive cyst and he said I hope not, so I take that as it is a possibility. My stomache is huge, my left ovary hurts, last night when I urinated I had pain in my left ovary. The same thing happened when I had the massive cysts, and whenever I would ovulate before I ever started taking the BC Pill. I also just left a message with my GP and see what she thinks. I am also going to ask her if she knows a name of another OB that she would recomened regarding this issue. I have been dealing with this for 5 months now, the holidays are litterly in a couple of weeks, I have a hous load of perople comming and with my luck I will probably be in massive pain by then.

My CholesteraL is elevated, my insulin levels are in the normal range, but the doctor told me that they do fluxuate, and my blood sugar is slightly high.

I lost count on how many internals he had to give me, but when they do the internals now they have been checking my uteris as well to make sure there aren't any cysts there. So far so good.

Just recently I had VERY high DHEAS levels, dr. said she never heard of anyone with this condition. She thinks it is lab error and is going to repeat test. Maybe yours was lab error too... a repeat test might be a good idea. I wish you luck... this thyroid thing can really upset our bodies hormones...

But when I asked the GYN when she did my pap just last month she said she didn't feel any cysts or anything?!?

Also she said my thyroid labs were good. BUT to me a TSH of 2.59 ( and I am on meds) still seems a bit high. It seems I don't feel my best until my TSH falls somewhere around 1ish.

I posted a few months ago because I found out I had HPV.

For the past 4-5 weeks I have had abnormal bleeding. My period is always irregular (ALWAYS since I started menstruating at 14...now I'm 27) So irregular that 9 times out of 10 I'm caught without a tampon...anyhow, for the past 4-5 weeks I've had cyclical abnormal bleeding....no period, just every 1 1/2 to 2 weeks had 2 or 3 days of spotting (mostly when I wipe really nothing on my underwear). I very very very minimal pain in my ovaries (like ovulation feeling) and no other symptoms. No pain, bloating, fever, no pain during urination and been with the same man for 4 years and been checked for STDs. My mom seems to think it may be a hormonal imbalance as I've had facial hair growth for over 2 years and weight gain....but I figured it was just me getting older (for the hair) and not working out or eating properly (although I never had problems before) I've made an appointment for Wednesday....but do you ladies have any ideas?

I am a SLIGHTLY overweight female and when I even think about the Dr. my blood pressure rockets and I start shaking...etc....yeah. Anyhow, input really helps...I'm glad I have an appointment and I'll try to remain calm. I'm thinking if it was something really really bad that I would have other symptoms...ESPECIALLY since they've thoroughly gone through the pap and ECC so recently. Maybe it IS PCOS. You know, without getting winded here; I went to the Dr. about PCOS about a year ago. I told her that one time I had to be rushed to the Dr. because I was in so much pain I could barely walk. She felt around said 'yep a cyst' and sent me on my way--that was 4 years ago. So a year ago I told my Dr. about this, told her about my facial hair, etc.. and she said 'well I don't feel any cysts in there so you don't have PCOS'. She did recommend bloodwork but I TOTALLY chickened out and didn't get it done.....sigh...there is something about needles.... like I said, input helps...and I'm thinking it is probably nothing bad especially since it is cyclical (every 2 weeks about) and I know when its coming (feels like ovulation) but then only wiped blood for about a day or 2. . (hear me? trying to convince myself its nothing? lol) thanks ladies...for listening to my rambling "}}}}
